TRUE	INTRODUCTION	A) INTRODUCTION

       Before: GIBBONS and KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judges; and SARGUS, District Judge.*
       KETHLEDGE, Circuit Judge. Phillip Badalament brought this action against United of
Omaha Life Insurance Company (“United”) after United denied his claim for life-insurance benefits
following the death of his brother, Paul Badalament. The district court granted United’s motion for
judgment on the administrative record, and Phillip now appeals. We affirm.

TRUE	DISCUSSION	Discussion

       Paul Badalament worked for Key Safety Systems (“Key”) as a commodities manager. Key
sponsored an employee-welfare benefit plan, which was governed by the Employee Retirement
Income Security Act (ERISA) and through which Paul obtained two group life-insurance policies.
       *
        The Honorable Edmund A. Sargus, Jr., United States District Judge for the Southern District
of Ohio, sitting by designation.
The policies were issued by United. Key Automotive Group, an affiliate of Key, formally served as
plan administrator but delegated its claims-processing authority to United.

TRUE	STANDARD OF REVIEW	B) Standard Of Review

       In January 2005—around the same time that Key started implementing a reduction-in-force
program—Paul went to his primary-care physician, Dr. Camisa, complaining of a fever, chills, a
cough, job stress, and depression. Dr. Camisa prescribed antibiotics and suggested that Paul meet
with a psychologist. Over the next two months, Paul saw Dr. Camisa three more times, had three
counseling sessions, and went to a hospital emergency room twice. The counseling and various
prescriptions helped to relieve some of his symptoms, but he also began to experience fatigue, blurry
vision, headaches, dizziness, and anxiety. He took a two-week leave of absence, during which time
he collected short-term-disability benefits. He returned to work on March 7, 2005.

TRUE	STATE	A. The State Cause of Problem

       Key terminated Paul’s employment on March 18, 2005, providing him with a severance
package that included a 20-week continuation of his salary and health-insurance—but not life-
insurance—coverage. Paul did not exercise an option to convert his group life-insurance policies
into individual policies.

       Paul next sought medical treatment on May 7, 2005, a little more than two months after his
last doctor’s visit. He reported some of the same symptoms as before, plus abdominal pain and heart
palpitations. As a result of those complaints, he consulted several specialists. Then, in late August,
Paul was admitted to a hospital for renal failure. He died on September 8, 2005, of complications
caused by multiple myeloma, a type of cancer.

       Phillip was the beneficiary of Paul’s life-insurance policies. He says he filed a claim with
Key in September 2005 and that Key denied it a few weeks later. He also says he appealed that
denial, but received no decision. He then brought this action in the district court. The court
dismissed his complaint without prejudice, finding that he had failed to exhaust his administrative
remedies because he should have submitted the claim to United rather than to Key.

TRUE	STATEMENT OF FACTS	Statement Of Facts

        Phillip thereafter presented his claim to United, which denied it after determining that Paul’s
coverage had ceased on March 31, 2005, the last day of the month in which his employment ended.
In making that determination, United considered—on its own initiative—whether Paul qualified for
extended coverage under a total-disability provision. Paul would have qualified for coverage under
that provision if he had been totally disabled on his last day of employment with Key. United
concluded, however, that any total disability Paul experienced did not occur until shortly before his
death. After an unsuccessful administrative appeal, Phillip returned to the district court. The court
reviewed the administrative record and entered judgment for United.
        This appeal followed.

TRUE	REMOVAL	II. Removal

        We review de novo the district court’s entry of judgment on an administrative record.
Whitaker v. Hartford Life & Accident Ins. Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="789931"><a href="/opinion/789931/bettye-whitaker-v-hartford-life-and-accident-insurance-company/"><span class="volume">404</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">947</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 949 (6th Cir. 2005). We apply the
same legal standard as the district court, which the parties agree here is the “arbitrary and capricious”
standard. See id. “[W]hen it is possible to offer a reasoned explanation, based on the evidence, for
a particular outcome, that outcome is not arbitrary or capricious.” Williams v. Int’l Paper Co., </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">227</span>
<span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">706</span></span><pre class="inline">, 712 (6th Cir. 2000) (citation omitted).

        Phillip argues that United acted arbitrarily and capriciously in determining that Paul was not
totally disabled on March 18, 2005, his last day of employment with Key. The insurance contracts
here define totally disabled as “completely and continuously unable to perform any work or engage
in any occupation” due to injury or sickness. (See Admin. R. 17.) Phillip argues essentially that Paul
was disabled in March 2005 because he then had cancer—albeit undiagnosed—which ultimately
proved to be fatal. The relevant question, however, is not whether Paul’s cancer unfortunately
proved to be fatal in September 2005, but whether it rendered him totally disabled in March of that
year.

        To answer that question, United evaluated Paul’s medical records. United’s medical director,
Dr. Tse, then summarized in a few paragraphs the main points upon which his determination relied.
He observed that Paul’s symptoms prior to March 31 were, for the most part, less severe than those
he experienced later in the year. Several of those early symptoms improved with treatment.
Moreover, none of Paul’s providers imposed any work restrictions upon him or opined that he was
disabled, and Paul himself never applied for Social Security disability benefits. In addition, on July
13, 2005, Paul told Dr. Camisa that he was looking for a job. Based on Paul’s medical records,
therefore, Dr. Tse determined that August 24, 2005, was the earliest time at which Paul became
totally disabled.

        Phillip offers only his own, non-medical opinion to challenge that determination. This case
thus stands in contrast to the cases he relies upon, where our arbitrary-and-capricious findings
depended heavily upon the presence of contrary professional assessments. See, e.g., DeLisle v. Sun
Life Assurance Co. of Can., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="1354269"><a href="/opinion/1354269/delisle-v-sun-life-assurance-co-of-canada/"><span class="volume">558</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">440</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 446-47 (6th Cir. 2009); Rochow v. Life Ins. Co. of N. Am.,
</pre><span class="citation" data-id="797390"><a href="/opinion/797390/daniel-j-rochow-v-life-insurance-co-of-north-america/"><span class="volume">482</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">860</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 864 (6th Cir. 2007); McDonald v. W.-S. Life. Ins. Co., </pre><span class="citation" data-id="783927"><a href="/opinion/783927/james-mcdonald-v-western-southern-life-insurance-company-western-southern/"><span class="volume">347</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">161</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 169-70 (6th Cir.2003). We see no basis on the record before us to hold that United’s determination that Paul was
not disabled on March 18, 2005 was arbitrary or capricious.

       Phillip argues, however, that “there is no ‘logical incompatibility between working full time
and being disabled from working full time.’” See Rochow, 482 F.3d at 865 (quoting Hawkins v.
First Union Corp. Long-Term Disability Plan, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">326</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">914</span></span><pre class="inline">, 918 (7th Cir. 2003)). But that depends
on how the contract defines total disability. The definitions in Rochow and Hawkins were
significantly narrower than the one here; indeed, having the ability to work and being “completely
and continuously unable to perform any work” could hardly be more incompatible. Moreover, in
Rochow, the insured technically remained on his employer’s payroll even though he “could no longer
perform the duties required of his position.” Id.; see also DeLisle, 558 F.3d at 443 (employee was
fired because “she was not doing her job”). Nothing in the record here suggests that Paul’s job
performance had deteriorated. Phillip does point to Paul’s short-term-disability leave between
February 22, 2005 and March 6, 2005; but that leave shows only that Paul experienced a period of
disability, not a continuous inability to work.

TRUE	CONCLUSION	CONCLUSION

       Phillip’s final argument is that conflicts of interest—United’s, as both decider of eligibility
and payer of benefits, and Dr. Tse’s, as United’s employee—rendered the denial arbitrary and
capricious. But his aspersions are no substitute for facts that show bias; and Phillip provides none
of those here.
       The district court’s judgment is affirmed.
