(June 27, 2007)
Before BLACK, HULL and MARCUS, Circuit Judges.
PER CURIAM:

     Patrick Thompson appeals his two 480-month sentences for conspiracy to
possess with intent to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C. §§ 841(a)(1),
846, and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and crack cocaine, 21 U.S.C.
§ 841(a)(1), as well as his concurrent 240-month sentence for obstruction of
justice, 18 U.S.C. § 1512(c)(1), which were imposed upon resentencing. After
review, we affirm.

TRUE	INTRODUCTION	I. BACKGROUND

      Acting on a tip from a confidential informant, police detained and then
arrested Thompson at a motel in Mobile, Alabama. A search of the motel room
uncovered 1.5 kilograms of cocaine and 217 grams of crack cocaine and a receipt
in Thompson’s name for a storage unit in Massachusetts. While in custody,
Thompson asked a woman named Tanya Lee to go to the storage unit in
Massachusetts to remove evidence. Lee complied and removed a suitcase that she
said contained a gun, money and crack cocaine. Thompson was tried and
convicted on charges of drug trafficking and obstruction of justice.

      In a prior appeal, this Court vacated Thompson’s sentences, concluding that
the district court committed constitutional Booker 1 error when it applied a firearm
enhancement to Thompson’s sentence, pursuant to U.S.S.G. § 2D1.1(b)(1), under a
mandatory guidelines scheme. See United States v. Thompson, No. 04-14722, 171

      1 United States v. Booker, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">543</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">220</span></span><pre class="inline">, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">125</span> <span class="reporter">S. Ct.</span> <span class="page">738</span></span><pre class="inline"> (2005).
F. App’x 823 (11th Cir. 2006). The Court noted that on remand the district court
should determine what sentence was reasonable after considering the guidelines as
advisory and the 18 U.S.C. § 3553(a) factors, but that issues already or necessarily
decided could not be reargued.2 Id. at 831 n.5.

TRUE	LEGAL FRAMEWORK	Legal Framework

       On remand, Thompson argued that he did not possess a firearm for purposes
of § 2D1.1(b)(1) and that such possession must be found by a jury. The district
court found by a preponderance of the evidence that Thompson possessed the gun
and applied the firearm enhancement in calculating Thompson’s advisory
guidelines range of 360 months to life imprisonment.

TRUE	CLAIM	Thompson's Claim

       Thompson also argued for a mandatory minimum 20-year sentence, below
the advisory guidelines range, because: (1) his father had induced him to try crack
and join the drug culture when Thompson was only thirteen years old; (2) his
ailing mother and his children relied upon him; (3) his drug operation had been
limited in scope; (4) he needed opportunities for rehabilitation; (5) other drug
defendants and his co-conspirators had received lesser sentences; and (6) it would
be unjust for him to spend such a significant portion of his life in jail.

       2 In his first appeal, with the exception of the Booker challenge to the firearm enhancement,
Thompson did not challenge the district court’s guidelines calculations. Thus, the district court’s
application of the guidelines, with the exception of the firearm enhancement, is the law of the case.
See United States v. Escobar-Urrego, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="71722"><a href="/opinion/71722/united-states-v-escobar-urrego/"><span class="volume">110</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">1556</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 1560-61 (11th Cir. 1997).

      During the sentencing hearing, the district court commented that
Thompson’s extensive criminal history was serious. The district court noted that it
had read the letters from Thompson’s relatives requesting a lesser sentence. While
acknowledging that the letter writers were good people, the district court
questioned their conclusion that Thompson was a good person given his extensive
criminal history. The district court stated that, based on Thompson’s criminal
record, it believed Thompson was not a good person, but a bad person who had
“appeared before judge after judge after judge in [his] history.” The district court
also stated that, under the circumstances, a minimum sentence would not be
appropriate, but wanted to hear what Thompson would say before choosing an
appropriate sentence.

      The district court then allowed Thompson to allocute. Thompson argued
that, although he had done some bad things, he had not committed any violent
crimes and did not believe that he deserved what amounted to almost a life
sentence. Thompson expressed remorse for his crimes and stated that he had a
good heart and believed that he could be rehabilitated. Thompson also asked for a
lesser sentence because his mother was ill.

      The district court acknowledged that it had heard Thompson and had come
to the hearing with an open mind, but felt that a 480-month sentence was
appropriate after considering the advisory guidelines and the § 3553(a) factors.
The district court stated that a 480-month sentence “meets the sentencing
objectives of punishment, deterrence and incapacitation.” Thompson filed this
appeal.

TRUE	DISCUSSION	II. DISCUSSION

       On appeal, Thompson contends that his sentence is unreasonable because the
district court failed to consider properly at sentencing Thompson’s arguments
made in mitigation.

TRUE	ARGUMENT	Thompson's Argument

       After United States v. Booker, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">543</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">220</span></span><pre class="inline">, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">125</span> <span class="reporter">S. Ct.</span> <span class="page">738</span></span><pre class="inline"> (2005), a district
court, in determining a reasonable sentence, must consider the correctly calculated
advisory guidelines range and the § 3553(a) factors. United States v. Talley, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="77183"><a href="/opinion/77183/united-states-v-john-kevin-talley/"><span class="volume">431</span>
<span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">784</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 786 (11th Cir. 2005).3 Although the district court must consider the § 3553(a) factors, “nothing in Booker or elsewhere requires the district court to
state on the record that it has explicitly considered each of the § 3553(a) factors or
to discuss each of the § 3553(a) factors.” United States v. Scott, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">426</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">1324</span></span><pre class="inline">,

        3 The § 3553(a) factors include: (1) the nature and circumstances of the offense and the
history and characteristics of the defendant; (2) the need to reflect the seriousness of the offense, to
promote respect for the law, and to provide just punishment for the offense; (3) the need for
deterrence; (4) the need to protect the public; (5) the need to provide the defendant with educational
or vocational training or medical care; (6) the kinds of sentences available; (7) the sentencing
guidelines range; (8) pertinent policy statements of the Sentencing Commission; (9) the need to
avoid unwarranted sentencing disparities; and (10) the need to provide restitution to victims. See
18 U.S.C. § 3553(a).
1329 (11th Cir. 2005). Rather, an acknowledgment by the district court that it has
considered the defendant’s arguments and the § 3553(a) factors will suffice. Id. at
1329-30.

      We review a defendant’s ultimate sentence for reasonableness in light of the
§ 3553(a) factors. United States v. Williams, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="77204"><a href="/opinion/77204/united-states-v-marcus-raqual-williams/"><span class="volume">435</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">1350</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 1353 (11th Cir. 2006). “[T]he party who challenges the sentence bears the burden of establishing
that the sentence is unreasonable in the light of both [the] record and the factors in
section 3553(a).” Talley, 431 F.3d at 788.

TRUE	CLAIM	District Claim

      During Thompson’s sentencing hearing, the district court stated that it had
considered the § 3553(a) factors and the advisory guidelines range. The district
court specifically noted Thompson’s extensive criminal history. The district court
also listened to and acknowledged all of Thompson’s arguments in mitigation of
his sentence, including the fact that his father introduced him to drugs at an early
age and that his co-defendants received lesser sentences. The district court was not
required to address each fact in mitigation or to address explicitly each § 3553(a)
factor. Given Thompson’s extensive criminal history and the seriousness of his
offenses, which included attempts to hide evidence after his arrest, we cannot say
that the district court’s 480-month sentences are unreasonable.

TRUE	CONCLUSION	CONCLUSION

      Thompson also argues that the district court’s application of the firearm
enhancement violated his Sixth Amendment rights. This argument is foreclosed by
United States v. Chau, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="77089"><a href="/opinion/77089/united-states-v-quan-chau/"><span class="volume">426</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">1318</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 1323-24 (11th Cir. 2005), in which we concluded that Booker does not prohibit extra-verdict enhancements under an
advisory guidelines system. Because Thompson was resentenced under an
advisory guidelines scheme, there was no Sixth Amendment violation.
      AFFIRMED.
