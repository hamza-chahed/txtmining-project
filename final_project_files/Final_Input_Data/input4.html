TRUE	INTRODUCTION	I. BACKGROUND

       KAREN NELSON MOORE, Circuit Judge. A Michigan jury convicted Willie James
Jones of second-degree murder, as well as both conspiracy to commit and solicitation to commit
first-degree murder. The district court denied Jones’s habeas petition on all grounds, but issued a
certificate of appealability on three claims: Jones’s trial counsel was ineffective because she opened
the door to previously excluded testimony; Jones’s multiple punishments for the same actions placed
him in double jeopardy; and inadequate evidence supported his convictions. For the reasons
explained below, we AFFIRM.

TRUE	STATEMENT OF FACTS	A. Substantive Facts

       On February 17, 2001, Kenneth Flowers (Flowers) was murdered by a man who has never
been identified. The shooter asked Flowers’s brother if he was Flowers, and when the brother said
no, the shooter departed. Soon the shooter returned, asked Flowers “What’s up?” and fatally shot
Flowers. R. 16 (06/16/03 Trial Tr., Dequan Flowers at 159–61). Flowers’s mother, Emma Flowers,
and her neighbor, Lucretia Adams (Adams), told an officer that they suspected Willie James Jones,
whom they knew by the nickname “Nookie.”

       McLister Trice was the link between Flowers and Jones. She had dated and had a child with
Jones, and dated Flowers from October 2000 to January 2001. After breaking up with Flowers three
weeks before the murder, Trice filed several police reports about Flowers vandalizing her car and
stalking her. She also obtained a personal protective order against him. Tensions escalated in early
February 2001, when Flowers followed Trice into a liquor store. Jones was with Trice, and an
argument ensued. Flowers struck Trice’s head, and in return Trice hit Flowers with a wine bottle.
Flowers ran from the store and told his companion, Jeff Adams, that Flowers had punched Jones and
that Jones had a gun. Jeff Adams testified to these facts, though he had not witnessed the fight.
Trice, however, insisted that Jones was not involved and did not have a gun.Around 10 a.m. on the morning of the shooting, Trice drove to the home of her stepmother,Patricia Wilson. Flowers, who lived across the street, approached Trice’s car and punched her
window. Adams testified that she overheard Trice tell Flowers “B----, you going to die today. Nook
-- my baby daddy Nook is setting it up now.” R. 17 (06/17/03 Trial Tr., Adams at 113). Emma
Flowers’s testimony was substantially similar. Id. (E. Flowers at 132) (“‘B----, you going to die
today. My baby daddy Nook is out making arrangements for you to be killed.’”). Trice denied
making these statements, and Jones denied telling Trice that he planned to kill Flowers.

TRUE	LEGAL FRAMEWORK	Legal Framework

       Afterward, Trice called her stepmother, Patricia Wilson. Wilson later testified that Trice told
her about the incident with Flowers and “that Nook was going to take care of it that day.” Id.
(Wilson at 103).Around noon, Jones stopped by Trice’s workplace. Trice told Jones and other people about
the encounter with Flowers. Around 4 p.m., Jones called Trice to say that “[t]he order had been
taken care of.” Id. (Trice at 40). Trice responded “[d]on’t go over there bothering him,” but Jones
said “I paid the n-----.” Id. at 40, 45. Three hours later and after the shooting, Jones visited Trice
at work again. Trice asked Jones whether he had “anything to do with it.” Id. at 44. Jones seemed
to be drinking and his response was ambiguous: “[w]hat you thought.” Id.

TRUE	PROCEDURE	B. Procedure

       Before Jones’s trial, the trial court excluded testimony from Emma Flowers and Adams about
Trice’s statement (“you going to die today; Nook is setting it up now”) because it appeared to be
double hearsay, lack foundation, and might fall outside of Michigan’s then-existing state-of-mind
exception to the hearsay prohibition. The trial court withheld judgment on whether the evidence
could be introduced to impeach Trice. The court also excluded Wilson’s testimony that Trice had
told her that Jones would take care of Trice’s problem with Flowers.

       The evidentiary issue reemerged at trial. On direct examination, Trice could not recall the
time at which she spoke to Jones. The government referenced a statement that Trice had given to
police after the shooting when she had been arrested for her own alleged involvement. The
government offered the statement to Trice to refresh her recollection. Trice then testified that, at 4
p.m., Jones had said “[t]he order had been taken care of” and “[h]e already paid someone.” Id. at
40. The government asked whether Trice had said anything to Flowers that morning, but the judge
sent the jury away before Trice answered. The judge informed the government’s counsel that it
would not permit questioning on an irrelevant point as a means of creating an innocuous
inconsistency from which to introduce Emma Flowers’s and Adams’s statements “under the guise
of impeachment.” Id. at 47. The judge then cautioned the defense attorney to constrain her
questions to avoid “open[ing] the door for the admission . . . of the heretofore barred . . . statements.”
Id. at 56–57.On cross-examination, Trice claimed that she did not know what Jones was talking about
when he mentioned paying someone to take care of an order. Defense counsel also asked a series
of questions to undermine the credibility of Trice’s statement to the police: she had been arrested,
was poorly treated, did not write the statement herself, and signed it while scared, threatened, and
hungry. Based on this latter set of questions, the trial court ruled that defense counsel had opened
the door to the hearsay statements, permitting the government to rehabilitate Trice with her
consistent, pre-arrest statements. Wilson, Emma Flowers, and Adams testified to the statements
“that Nook was going to take care of it that day,” id. (Wilson at 103), and “[b]----, you going to die
today. Nook -- my baby daddy Nook is setting it up now,” id. (Adams at 113); see also id. (E.
Flowers at 132). Defense counsel objected specifically to Adams’s testimony but the judge admitted
it both as a prior consistent statement and for impeachment. The attorney did not request a limiting
instruction.

       The jury convicted Jones of second-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree
murder, and solicitation of first-degree murder. He is serving concurrent sentences of life
imprisonment for conspiracy, nineteen-to-thirty years of imprisonment for second-degree murder,
and nineteen-to-thirty years of imprisonment for solicitation of first-degree murder. The Michigan
Court of Appeals affirmed the convictions, People v. Jones, No. 250326, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2005</span> <span class="reporter">WL</span> <span class="page">657578</span></span><pre class="inline"> (Mich.
Ct. App. March 22, 2005) (unpublished opinion), and the Michigan Supreme Court declined leave
to appeal. Following his direct appeal, Jones filed his habeas petition with the district court. The
district court denied relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the three issues that are now
before this court: ineffective assistance of trial counsel, multiple punishments in violation of the
Double Jeopardy Clause, and sufficiency of the evidence. Jones v. Harry, No. 06-13465, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2009</span> <span class="reporter">WL</span>
<span class="page">275728</span></span><pre class="inline"> (E.D. Mich. 2009) (unpublished opinion).

TRUE	ANALYSIS	II. ANALYSIS
	
TRUE	STANDARD OF REVIEW	A. Standard of Review

       “In a habeas corpus proceeding, this Court reviews a district court’s legal conclusions de
novo and its factual findings for clear error.” Goff v. Bagley, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="1293"><a href="/opinion/1293/goff-v-bagley/"><span class="volume">601</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">445</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 455 (6th Cir. 2010)
(quotation omitted).

       Michigan state courts adjudicated the merits of Jones’s claims, and the Antiterrorism and
Effective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) applies. As a result, we can afford relief on the ineffective-
assistance and double-jeopardy claims only if the Michigan decision was “contrary to, or involved
an unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court
of the United States.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(1). As to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the
Michigan decision to see if it was “based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of
the evidence presented in the State court proceeding.” 28 U.S.C. § 2254(d)(2).

TRUE	STATEMENT OF THE CASE	B. Ineffective Assistance in the case

       Jones challenges the assistance of his trial counsel on two bases. First, he asserts that his
attorney provided ineffective assistance by opening the door for Trice’s prior statements to come into
evidence by discrediting Trice’s statement to the police, even though her statement to the police was
not actually admitted into evidence. Second, he complains that his attorney did not request that the
judge instruct the jury to consider Wilson’s, Adams’s, and Emma Flowers’s testimony only for its
impeachment value. To succeed on his ineffective-assistance claim, Jones must show that the state
courts unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="111170"><a href="/opinion/111170/strickland-v-washington/"><span class="volume">466</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">668</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 687 (1984), which requires both deficient performance and prejudice to the defense. Attorney performance is deficient if
“counsel’s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonableness” by making “errors so
serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment.”
Id. at 687–88. “Our review of counsel’s performance is highly deferential and counsel is strongly
presumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of
reasonable professional judgment.” Johnson v. Bell, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="1316759"><a href="/opinion/1316759/johnson-v-bell/"><span class="volume">525</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">466</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 487 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal quotation marks omitted).

TRUE	JURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT	1. Opening the Door For Prejudicial Hearsay

       Opening the door to damaging testimony can constitute deficient performance. See, e.g.,
White v. Thaler, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="149809"><a href="/opinion/149809/white-v-thaler/"><span class="volume">610</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">890</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 900 (5th Cir. 2010). Here, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals found that opening the door was a necessary consequence of the defense’s much-needed attack on
Trice’s credibility. That consequence was damaging, but we consider it in context, alongside the
beneficial results of the strategy and in light of counsel’s slim options. See Wiggins v. Smith, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="130159"><a href="/opinion/130159/wiggins-v-smith-warden/"><span class="volume">539</span>
<span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">510</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 523 (2003) (using “a context-dependent consideration of the challenged [attorney] conduct”).

TRUE	DISCUSSION	III. DISCUSSION

       On direct examination, Trice had testified to Jones’s statements that “[t]he order had been
taken care of,” “[h]e already paid someone,” and he had done “[w]hat you thought.” R. 17 (06/17/03
Trial Tr., Trice at 40, 44). Although Trice’s police statement had not been admitted into evidence,
the jury was aware of her statement to police because the prosecution had referenced it when
refreshing Trice’s recollection. Jones admits that direct examination implied that the police report
was consistent with Trice’s statements. Doing nothing to counter these damaging claims and
implications on cross-examination would not have been a wise choice, despite what Jones argues
now. The Michigan Court of Appeals did not unreasonably determine that, “[b]ecause of the nature
of [Trice’s statements on direct], defense counsel would have been remiss not to address the
statements on cross-examination and attempt to explain them.” Jones, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2005</span> <span class="reporter">WL</span> <span class="page">657578</span></span><pre class="inline">, at *3.

TRUE	ACT	C. Precedent Under Federal Communications Acts

       Debunking the police report removed any enhanced credibility that the police report had
added to Trice’s testimony. Jones argues that his attorney performed deficiently because she acted
on the false belief that the police report was in evidence. But his attorney explicitly confirmed her
understanding that the statement was not in evidence. R. 17 at 79 (“THE COURT: ‘You know, her
statement is actually not in evidence, [defense counsel]. Her trial testimony is.’ [DEFENSE
COUNSEL]: ‘I understand.’”). Defense counsel’s cross-examination was directed at “what the
prosecutor said when he was asking [Trice] questions. He asked about her [police] statement, what
she said in her statement.” Id.

	Some portions of the cross-examination strategy did not depend on the police report. For
example, the defense attorney extracted from Trice that she did not know what Jones was talking
about when he referenced the order that he had taken care of or when he said that he had paid
someone. The judge had warned the defense attorney about the risk of opening the door to
previously excluded testimony. In hindsight, perhaps refraining from asking about the police report
would have been a better strategy. But given the deference with which we review attorney decisions,
we cannot say that the state courts were unreasonable in concluding that the choice was not
constitutionally deficient. The circumstances of the police report—Trice’s own arrest as well as her
maltreatment—make her statements dubious. That line of questioning may have had more force than
did Trice’s admission that she felt that Jones’s statements were ambiguous. Also, each of the
hearsay statements relies on Trice’s credibility as a declarant. Jones’s trial counsel reasonably might
have decided that the benefit of casting doubt on Trice’s testimony outweighed the harm of new
witnesses testifying to statements similar to what that the jury had already heard.

TRUE	APPLICATION	III. Application

       The Michigan Court of Appeals held that “[c]ounsel’s strategy was clearly to try to show that
Trice did not know what defendant meant by the statements. Given counsel’s limited options, this
strategy was not unsound.” Jones, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2005</span> <span class="reporter">WL</span> <span class="page">657578</span></span><pre class="inline">, at *3. The attorney’s strategy was somewhat
broader in that it probed the circumstances of the police report, but the state court was not
unreasonable in determining that the attorney exercised professional judgment and provided
constitutionally adequate assistance. Thus, Jones cannot demonstrate ineffective assistance of
counsel.

TRUE	STATEMENT OF FACTS	2. Fact of Failing to Request A Limiting Instruction

       Although Jones briefs the issue on appeal, his habeas petition does not allege that trial
counsel’s performance was deficient for failing to request a limiting instruction for the testimony of
Wilson, Emma Flowers, or Adams. While the claim bears some resemblance to his first ineffective-
assistance claim, his petition did not fairly raise the issue of limiting instructions. We therefore may
not review the claim. See Seymour v. Walker, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="770145"><a href="/opinion/770145/beverly-a-seymour-v-diane-walkerrespondent-appellee/"><span class="volume">224</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">542</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 561 (6th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">532</span>
<span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">989</span></span><pre class="inline"> (2001).

TRUE	STATEMENT OF FACTS	3. Double Jeopardy Fact

       The Fifth Amendment ensures that no one may “be subject for the same offence to be twice
put in jeopardy of life or limb.” U.S. CONST . amend. V. That clause protects criminal defendants
from prosecution following conviction or acquittal for the same offense, and also prohibits infliction
of “multiple punishments for the same offense imposed in a single proceeding.” Jones v. Thomas,
</pre><span class="citation" data-id="112303"><a href="/opinion/112303/jones-v-thomas/"><span class="volume">491</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">376</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 381 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). “With respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court
from prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.” Missouri v. Hunter, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="110824"><a href="/opinion/110824/missouri-v-hunter/"><span class="volume">459</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span>
<span class="page">359</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 366 (1983). In fact, “the Court has never held or intimated that the constitutional bar against double jeopardy circumscribes the legislative prerogative to define crimes and prescribe punishment
in the context of a single prosecution.” White v. Howes, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="1381175"><a href="/opinion/1381175/white-v-howes/"><span class="volume">586</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">1025</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 1032 (6th Cir. 2009), cert.
denied, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">130</span> <span class="reporter">S. Ct.</span> <span class="page">3370</span></span><pre class="inline"> (2010). “Even if the crimes are the same under Blockburger [v. United

punishments, a court’s inquiry is at an end.” Ohio v. Johnson, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="111207"><a href="/opinion/111207/ohio-v-johnson/"><span class="volume">467</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">493</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 499 n.8 (1984); see also White, 586 F.3d at 1032 (denying habeas even though the panel “agree[d] . . . that the two statutes
at issue . . . punish the same offense under Blockburger”).We owe the Michigan courts deference even if, as seems to be the case, Jones’s appeal was the first time that they ruled on the issue. Because “the only question for the [Michigan] Court of
Appeals was what the legislature had intended,” any error in its reasoning “is purely a matter of state
law.” McCloud v. Deppisch, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="790443"><a href="/opinion/790443/kevin-r-mccloud-v-jodine-deppisch/"><span class="volume">409</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">869</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 874 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="1991570"><a href="/opinion/1991570/teresa-v-ragaglia/"><span class="volume">546</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">1063</span></a></span><pre class="inline"> (2005); see
also Banner v. Davis, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="529983"><a href="/opinion/529983/kelly-gene-banner-v-herman-c-davis-warden/"><span class="volume">886</span> <span class="reporter">F.2d</span> <span class="page">777</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 782 (6th Cir. 1989) (holding that we may not “independently evaluate the scope of the Tennessee statutes here, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals and
[Tennessee] Supreme Court having already held that the legislature intended cumulative
punishments”).1 “[T]he fact that the state court’s interpretation of state law happens to be central
Jones points to language in Banner limiting its relevance when the state courts “failed to
give a clear expression on the issue of cumulative punishment.” Banner, 886 F.2d at 782. Banner
used that language to distinguish Pryor v. Rose, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="429436"><a href="/opinion/429436/robert-earl-pryor-v-james-h-rose-warden/"><span class="volume">724</span> <span class="reporter">F.2d</span> <span class="page">525</span></a></span><pre class="inline"> (6th Cir. 1984) (en banc), an opinion to the double jeopardy analysis does not permit us to review the [Michigan] Court of Appeals’ construction of [its own] law.” McCloud, 409 F.3d at 875. It does not matter, as Jones argues, that
the state appellate decision was not precedential or that only a state’s supreme court can issue a
binding interpretation of state law. The state court’s decision of state law is not cognizable on
habeas review.

TRUE	INTRODUCTION	BACKGROUND

       Jones cites Brown v. Ohio, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="109695"><a href="/opinion/109695/brown-v-ohio/"><span class="volume">432</span> <span class="reporter">U.S.</span> <span class="page">161</span></a></span><pre class="inline"> (1977), as an example of the Supreme Court reviewing the state court’s reasoning on a double jeopardy claim. In that case, the Court said that
it “agree[d] with the Ohio Court of Appeals that joyriding and auto theft, as defined by the [state]
court, constitute the same statutory offense within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.” Id.
at 168. Put differently, the Court agreed that, given the lack of legislative authorization for multiple
punishments, the convictions in Brown violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.A multiple-
punishments challenge takes root only if the legislature did not authorize multiple punishments.
When it has, there is no federal issue with which a federal court can agree or disagree. See Banner,
886 F.2d at 782 (rejecting the reading of Brown advocated by Jones).In this case, we must accept the Michigan Court of Appeals’ construction of the Michigan statutes: the murder statute “protect[s] human life and prohibit[s] wrongful slayings”; the conspiracy
statute “protect[s] society from the increased danger presented by group activity”; and the solicitation
that did not make clear how—or whether—the state court had decided the double-jeopardy question.
Banner, 886 F.2d at 782 & n.2. The Banner panel resolved the confusion by holding that we must
defer to state-court holdings when the state “courts have carefully considered and analyzed the scope
of the [state] statutes.” Id. at 782. The Michigan Court of Appeals did so in this case, and we are
bound by Banner. statute “pr[o]scribe[s] the inducement of another to commit an offense.” Jones, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">2005</span> <span class="reporter">WL</span> <span class="page">657578</span></span><pre class="inline">,
at *5. A federal court reviewing a habeas petition may not, as Jones requests, reexamine the role of
Michigan’s rule of lenity, the level of generality at which to examine the purpose of each statute, or
whether Michigan’s legislature intended to punish a single act of procurement under three statutes.
Given the distinct purposes of the statutes of conviction, there is no colorable argument that the
Double Jeopardy Clause protects Jones from being convicted under all three statutes.

TRUE	STATEMENT OF FACTS	D. Sufficiency of the Evidence Fact

       Under AEDPA, challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict a petitioner
must survive “two layers of deference to groups who might view facts differently than we would.”
Brown v. Konteh, </pre><span class="citation" data-id="1208576"><a href="/opinion/1208576/brown-v-konteh/"><span class="volume">567</span> <span class="reporter">F.3d</span> <span class="page">191</span></a></span><pre class="inline">, 205 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, </pre><span class="citation no-link"><span class="volume">130</span> <span class="reporter">S. Ct.</span> <span class="page">1081</span></span><pre class="inline"> (2010).
Id. (citations omitted). Jones challenges each of his three convictions, but he disputes the sufficiency
of the evidence only as to (1) his intent and (2) his performance of acts that assisted in or his
encouragement of the murder. Sufficient evidence supports both elements.

TRUE	ACT	C. Precedent Under Federal Communications Acts.

        One element of second-degree murder is the “intent to kill, . . . inflict great bodily harm, or

In this case, a jury could reasonably find that Jones intended to have the victim killed and intended
to make an agreement to kill the victim. Adams and Emma Flowers both testified that, based on the
statement that they overheard Trice make, Jones was arranging to have the victim killed. Jones’s
statements to Trice—that “[t]he order had been taken care of,” that he had “paid the n-----,” and,
when asked “whether he had anything to do with” the victim’s death, he responded “[w]hat you
thought,” R. 17 (06/17/03 Trial Tr., Trice at 40, 42–45)—could be interpreted as evidence of intent.
The liquor-store conflict and Trice’s difficulties with the victim also supply limited circumstantial
support. Resolving factual disputes in favor of the prosecution, we cannot conclude that it was
unreasonable for the Michigan Court of Appeals to determine that a rational trier of fact could find
that Jones had intended to kill Flowers.

TRUE	ACT	B. The Pole Attachment Act.

       For similar reasons, the Michigan Court of Appeals was not unreasonable in finding that
Jones performed acts or gave encouragement to the shooter, as is required under an aiding-and-
abetting theory, Robinson, 715 N.W.2d at 47–48, and that Jones made an agreement to commit
murder, which is required for a conspiracy conviction, Carter, 330 N.W.2d at 319. Trice testified
that Jones told her that he had paid someone and “taken care of” the “order.” R. 17 (06/17/03 Trial
Tr., Trice at 40). Her testimony provides a sufficient basis for the Michigan Court of Appeals to
have found that a reasonable jury could have convicted Jones.


TRUE	CONCLUSION	III. CONCLUSION


       For the reasons explained above, we AFFIRM the district court’s denial of habeas relief.
