    " - Words can be grouped into classes, such as nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. These classes are known as lexical categories or parts of speech. Parts of speech are assigned short labels, or tags, such as NN, VB,\n",
    "- The process of automatically assigning parts of speech to words in text is called part-of-speech tagging, POS tagging, or just tagging.\n",
    "- Automatic tagging is an important step in the NLP pipeline, and is useful in a variety of situations including: predicting the behavior of previously unseen words, analyzing word usage in corpora, and text-to-speech systems.\n",
    "- Some linguistic corpora, such as the Brown Corpus, have been POS tagged.\n",
    "- A variety of tagging methods are possible, e.g. default tagger, regular expression tagger, unigram tagger and n-gram taggers. These can be combined using a technique known as backoff.\n",
    "- Taggers can be trained and evaluated using tagged corpora.\n",
    "- Backoff is a method for combining models: when a more specialized model (such as a bigram tagger) cannot assign a tag in a given context, we backoff to a more general model (such as a unigram tagger).\n",
    "- Part-of-speech tagging is an important, early example of a sequence classification task in NLP: a classification decision at any one point in the sequence makes use of words and tags in the local context.\n",
    "- A dictionary is used to map between arbitrary types of information, such as a string and a number: freq['cat'] = 12. We create dictionaries using the brace notation: pos = {}, pos = {'furiously': 'adv', 'ideas': 'n', 'colorless': 'adj'}.\n",
    "- N-gram taggers can be defined for large values of n, but once n is larger than 3 we usually encounter the sparse data problem; even with a large quantity of training data we only see a tiny fraction of possible contexts.\n",
    "- Transformation-based tagging involves learning a series of repair rules of the form \"change tag s to tag t in context c\", where each rule fixes mistakes and possibly introduces a (smaller) number of errors."

    "- ☼ Working with someone else, take turns to pick a word that can be either a noun or a verb (e.g. contest); the opponent has to predict which one is likely to be the most frequent in the Brown corpus; check the opponent's prediction, and tally the score over several turns.\n",
    "- ☼ Tokenize and tag the following sentence: They wind back the clock, while we chase after the wind. What different pronunciations and parts of speech are involved?\n",
    "- ☼ Review the mappings in 3.1. Discuss any other examples of mappings you can think of. What type of information do they map from and to?\n",

    "- ☼ Try deleting an element from a dictionary d, using the syntax del d['abc']. Check that the item was deleted.\n",
    "- ☼ Create two dictionaries, d1 and d2, and add some entries to each. Now issue the command d1.update(d2). What did this do? What might it be useful for?\n",

    "- ☼ Satisfy yourself that there are restrictions on the distribution of go and went, in the sense that they cannot be freely interchanged in the kinds of contexts illustrated in (3d) in 7.\n",
    "- ☼ Train a unigram tagger and run it on some new text. Observe that some words are not assigned a tag. Why not?\n",
    "- ☼ Learn about the affix tagger (type help(nltk.AffixTagger)). Train an affix tagger and run it on some new text. Experiment with different settings for the affix length and the minimum word length. Discuss your findings.\n",

    "- What happens to the tagger performance for the various model sizes when a backoff tagger is omitted?\n",
    "- Consider the curve in 4.2; suggest a good size for a lookup tagger that balances memory and performance. Can you come up with scenarios where it would be preferable to minimize memory usage, or to maximize performance with no regard for memory usage?\n",
    "- ◑ What is the upper limit of performance for a lookup tagger, assuming no limit to the size of its table? (Hint: write a program to work out what percentage of tokens of a word are assigned the most likely tag for that word, on average.)\n",
    "- ◑ Generate some statistics for tagged data to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- What proportion of word types are always assigned the same part-of-speech tag?\n",
    "- How many words are ambiguous, in the sense that they appear with at least two tags?\n",
    "- What percentage of word tokens in the Brown Corpus involve these ambiguous words?\n",
    "- ◑ The evaluate() method works out how accurately the tagger performs on this text. For example, if the supplied tagged text was [('the', 'DT'), ('dog', 'NN')] and the tagger produced the output [('the', 'NN'), ('dog', 'NN')], then the score would be 0.5. Let's try to figure out how the evaluation method works:\n",
    "- A tagger t takes a list of words as input, and produces a list of tagged words as output. However, t.evaluate() is given correctly tagged text as its only parameter. What must it do with this input before performing the tagging?\n",
    "- Once the tagger has created newly tagged text, how might the evaluate() method go about comparing it with the original tagged text and computing the accuracy score?\n",
    "- Now examine the source code to see how the method is implemented. Inspect nltk.tag.api.__file__ to discover the location of the source code, and open this file using an editor (be sure to use the api.py file and not the compiled api.pyc binary file).\n",
    "- ◑ Write code to search the Brown Corpus for particular words and phrases according to tags, to answer the following questions:\n",
    "- Produce an alphabetically sorted list of the distinct words tagged as MD.\n",
    "- Identify words that can be plural nouns or third person singular verbs (e.g. deals, flies).\n",
    "- Identify three-word prepositional phrases of the form IN + DET + NN (eg. in the lab).\n",
    "- What is the ratio of masculine to feminine pronouns?\n",
    "- ◑ In 3.1 we saw a table involving frequency counts for the verbs adore, love, like, prefer and preceding qualifiers absolutely and definitely. Investigate the full range of adverbs that appear before these four verbs.\n",
    "- ◑ We defined the regexp_tagger that can be used as a fall-back tagger for unknown words. This tagger only checks for cardinal numbers. By testing for particular prefix or suffix strings, it should be possible to guess other tags. For example, we could tag any word that ends with -s as a plural noun. Define a regular expression tagger (using RegexpTagger()) that tests for at least five other patterns in the spelling of words. (Use inline documentation to explain the rules.)\n",
    "- ◑ Consider the regular expression tagger developed in the exercises in the previous section. Evaluate the tagger using its accuracy() method, and try to come up with ways to improve its performance. Discuss your findings. How does objective evaluation help in the development process?\n",
    "- ◑ How serious is the sparse data problem? Investigate the performance of n-gram taggers as n increases from 1 to 6. Tabulate the accuracy score. Estimate the training data required for these taggers, assuming a vocabulary size of 105 and a tagset size of 102.\n",
    "- ◑ Obtain some tagged data for another language, and train and evaluate a variety of taggers on it. If the language is morphologically complex, or if there are any orthographic clues (e.g. capitalization) to word classes, consider developing a regular expression tagger for it (ordered after the unigram tagger, and before the default tagger). How does the accuracy of your tagger(s) compare with the same taggers run on English data? Discuss any issues you encounter in applying these methods to the language.\n",
    "- ◑ 4.1 plotted a curve showing change in the performance of a lookup tagger as the model size was increased. Plot the performance curve for a unigram tagger, as the amount of training data is varied.\n",
    "- ◑ Inspect the confusion matrix for the bigram tagger t2 defined in 5, and identify one or more sets of tags to collapse. Define a dictionary to do the mapping, and evaluate the tagger on the simplified data.\n",
    "- ◑ Experiment with taggers using the simplified tagset (or make one of your own by discarding all but the first character of each tag name). Such a tagger has fewer distinctions to make, but much less information on which to base its work. Discuss your findings.\n",
    "- ◑ Recall the example of a bigram tagger which encountered a word it hadn't seen during training, and tagged the rest of the sentence as None. It is possible for a bigram tagger to fail part way through a sentence even if it contains no unseen words (even if the sentence was used during training). In what circumstance can this happen? Can you write a program to find some examples of this?\n",
    "- ◑ Preprocess the Brown News data by replacing low frequency words with UNK, but leaving the tags untouched. Now train and evaluate a bigram tagger on this data. How much does this help? What is the contribution of the unigram tagger and default tagger now?\n",
    "- ◑ Modify the program in 4.1 to use a logarithmic scale on the x-axis, by replacing pylab.plot() with pylab.semilogx(). What do you notice about the shape of the resulting plot? Does the gradient tell you anything?\n",
    "- ◑ Consult the documentation for the Brill tagger demo function, using help(nltk.tag.brill.demo). Experiment with the tagger by setting different values for the parameters. Is there any trade-off between training time (corpus size) and performance?\n",
    "- ◑ Write code that builds a dictionary of dictionaries of sets. Use it to store the set of POS tags that can follow a given word having a given POS tag, i.e. wordi → tagi → tagi+1.\n",
    "- ★ There are 264 distinct words in the Brown Corpus having exactly three possible tags.\n",
    "- Print a table with the integers 1..10 in one column, and the number of distinct words in the corpus having 1..10 distinct tags in the other column.\n",
    "- For the word with the greatest number of distinct tags, print out sentences from the corpus containing the word, one for each possible tag.\n",
    "- ★ Write a program to classify contexts involving the word must according to the tag of the following word. Can this be used to discriminate between the epistemic and deontic uses of must?\n",
    "- ★ Create a regular expression tagger and various unigram and n-gram taggers, incorporating backoff, and train them on part of the Brown corpus.\n",
    "- Create three different combinations of the taggers. Test the accuracy of each combined tagger. Which combination works best?\n",
    "- Try varying the size of the training corpus. How does it affect your results?\n",
    "- ★ Our approach for tagging an unknown word has been to consider the letters of the word (using RegexpTagger()), or to ignore the word altogether and tag it as a noun (using nltk.DefaultTagger()). These methods will not do well for texts having new words that are not nouns. Consider the sentence I like to blog on Kim's blog. If blog is a new word, then looking at the previous tag (TO versus NP$) would probably be helpful. I.e. we need a default tagger that is sensitive to the preceding tag.\n",
    "- Create a new kind of unigram tagger that looks at the tag of the previous word, and ignores the current word. (The best way to do this is to modify the source code for UnigramTagger(), which presumes knowledge of object-oriented programming in Python.)\n",
    "- Add this tagger to the sequence of backoff taggers (including ordinary trigram and bigram taggers that look at words), right before the usual default tagger.\n",
    "- Evaluate the contribution of this new unigram tagger.\n",
    "- ★ Consider the code in 5 which determines the upper bound for accuracy of a trigram tagger. Review Abney's discussion concerning the impossibility of exact tagging (Church, Young, & Bloothooft, 1996). Explain why correct tagging of these examples requires access to other kinds of information than just words and tags. How might you estimate the scale of this problem?\n",
    "- ★ Use some of the estimation techniques in nltk.probability, such as Lidstone or Laplace estimation, to develop a statistical tagger that does a better job than n-gram backoff taggers in cases where contexts encountered during testing were not seen during training.\n",
    "- ★ Inspect the diagnostic files created by the Brill tagger rules.out and errors.out. Obtain the demonstration code by accessing the source code (at http://www.nltk.org/code) and create your own version of the Brill tagger. Delete some of the rule templates, based on what you learned from inspecting rules.out. Add some new rule templates which employ contexts that might help to correct the errors you saw in  errors.out.\n",
    "- ★ Develop an n-gram backoff tagger that permits \"anti-n-grams\" such as [\"the\", \"the\"] to be specified when a tagger is initialized. An anti-ngram is assigned a count of zero and is used to prevent backoff for this n-gram (e.g. to avoid estimating P(the | the) as just P(the)).\n",
    "- ★ Investigate three different ways to define the split between training and testing data when developing a tagger using the Brown Corpus: genre (category), source (fileid), and sentence. Compare their relative performance and discuss which method is the most legitimate. (You might use n-fold cross validation, discussed in 3, to improve the accuracy of the evaluations.)\n",
    "- ★ Develop your own NgramTagger class that inherits from NLTK's class, and which encapsulates the method of collapsing the vocabulary of the tagged training and testing data that was described in this chapter. Make sure that the unigram and default backoff taggers have access to the full vocabulary."
