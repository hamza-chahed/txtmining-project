Â§ 1441, which provides: â\\x80\\x9c(a) Except as\\n\\notherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of\\n\\nwhich the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the\\n\\ndefendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division\\n\\nembracing the place where such action is pending.â\\x80\\x9d Federal district courts have â\\x80\\x9cfederal\\n\\nquestionâ\\x80\\x9d jurisdiction over â\\x80\\x9call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the\\n\\nUnited States,â\\x80\\x9d 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331, and diversity jurisdiction over citizens of different states, 28\\n\\nU.S.C. Â§ 1332.

In the Grable & Sons case, the United States\\n\\n\\n                                                   7\\nSupreme Court recognized that the â\\x80\\x9carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United\\n\\nStatesâ\\x80\\x9d provision for federal-question jurisdiction is most often invoked by plaintiffs pleading a\\n\\ncause of action expressly created by federal law, such as claims under 42 U.S.C.

E.g., Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U.S.\\n        486, 490-491(1917). The doctrine captures the commonsense notion that a federal\\n        court ought to be able to hear claims recognized under state law that nonetheless\\n        turn on substantial questions of federal law, and thus justify resort to the\\n        experience, solicitude, and hope of uniformity that a federal forum offers on\\n        federal issues, see ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and\\n        Federal Courts 164-166 (1968).\\n\\n545 U.S. at 312 (parallel citations omitted).\\n\\n        But, the Court further explained, â\\x80\\x9carising underâ\\x80\\x9d jurisdiction does not take an â\\x80\\x9cexpansive\\n\\nview that mere need to apply federal law in a state-law claim will suffice to open the â\\x80\\x98arising\\n\\nunderâ\\x80\\x99 door . . . ,â\\x80\\x9d and noted that early-on, the Court had â\\x80\\x9cconfined federal-question jurisdiction\\n\\nover state-law claims to those that â\\x80\\x98really and substantially involv[e] a dispute or controversy\\n\\nrespecting the validity, construction or effect of [federal] law. . . .â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 313 (citations\\n\\nomitted).

However, if a state claim does not come within this\\n          doctrine, the well-pleaded complaint rule still applies, and the district court does not\\n          have removal jurisdiction unless a federal cause of action is pled. Even if the complete\\n          preemption does not apply, the defendant may nonetheless claim federal preemption as\\n          defense [in state court].\\n\\nJoyce, 126 F.3d at 171 (citation omitted). See also Goepel, 36 F.3d at 310; Railway Labor\\n\\nExecutives, 858 F.2d at 942.\\n\\n       As succinctly explained by a colleague in the Eastern District:\\n\\n       Complete preemption is a jurisdictional doctrine that transforms state claims into\\n       federal claims, even if they have been pleaded purely under state law. Aetna\\n       Health Inc. v. Davila, 542 U.S. 200, 207 (2004). Complete preemption is not to be\\n       confused with â\\x80\\x9cordinaryâ\\x80\\x9d preemption. In tort suits, ordinary preemption operates\\n\\n\\n                                                  12\\n       as a defense to override state laws in conflict with federal laws, but it cannot\\n       create federal jurisdiction on its own. Long established black-letter law dictates\\n       that a â\\x80\\x9cwell pleaded complaintâ\\x80\\x9d resting on purely state law grounds never give\\n       rises to federal jurisdiction, even if a federal defense, such as ordinary preemption,\\n       plainly exists. See, e.g., Louisville & Nashville R. Co. v. Mottley, 211 U.S. 149\\n       (1908). The well-pleaded state law complaint can only be pulled into federal court\\n       if it is completely preempted - that is, â\\x80\\x9cwhen a federal statute wholly displaces the\\n       state-law cause of action.â\\x80\\x9d Beneficial Nat.

One manner in which the State can\\nremove the fear of incrimination and compel testimony is to grant the witness immunity\\nthat is coextensive with the witness\\' right against self-incrimination.\\n\\n                                              1\\n4.\\n        A grant of immunity that merely prohibits the use of the compelled testimony in\\nany potential future case, without immunizing any evidence that might be derived from\\nthe compelled testimony, is not coextensive with the witness\\' Fifth Amendment right\\nagainst self-incrimination.\\n\\n\\n5.\\n        A court cannot lawfully compel a witness to testify based upon the State\\'s grant of\\nmere use immunity. If a court holds a witness in contempt for invoking his or her right\\nagainst self-incrimination, when that witness has not been granted immunity that is\\ncoextensive with the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, the order of\\ncontempt must be reversed and the sanction imposed must be vacated.\\n\\n\\n        Review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals in 52 Kan.

Because the State did not offer Delacruz use and derivative\\nuse immunity that protected his constitutional right against self-incrimination, the district\\n\\n\\n\\n                                                     2\\ncourt erred in holding Delacruz in contempt of court for invoking his constitutional right\\nto remain silent. We reverse the order of contempt and vacate the sentence.\\n\\n\\nTRUE\\tSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\tFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL OVERVIEW\\n\\n\\n       The State charged Delacruz with aggravated robbery and felony murder, based\\nupon an incident in which Joshua Haines was allegedly murdered during the commission\\nof a robbery by Delacruz and four others, including Anthony Waller. A jury convicted\\nDelacruz of aggravated robbery but acquitted him of felony murder; the court sentenced\\nDelacruz to an 83-month prison sentence. The conviction and sentence were upheld on\\nappeal. State v. Delacruz, No. 106,082, 2012 WL 1352865 (Kan. App. 2012)\\n(unpublished opinion), rev. denied 299 Kan. 1271 (2014) (Delacruz I).\\n\\n\\n       After Delacruz\\' trial was completed, the State subpoenaed him to be a witness at\\nWaller\\'s murder trial. When Delacruz attempted to invoke his Fifth Amendment right\\nagainst self-incrimination, the State informed the district court that it was granting\\nDelacruz immunity for his testimony. The written grant of immunity proffered by the\\nState, titled \"GRANT OF USE IMMUNITY,\" stated:\\n\\n\\n               \"COMES NOW the Plaintiff, State of Kansas, by and through Reno County\\n       District Attorney of the 27th Judicial District, Keith E. Schroeder, pursuant to the\\n       authority vested in me as District Attorney, by K.S.A. 22-3415(a)(c), do hereby grant to:\\n       Jose G. Delacruz, immunity from the use of any testimony given in the above-captioned\\n       matter on February 28, 2011 through March 9, 2011. I, Keith E. Schroeder, District\\n       Attorney, grants [sic] this use immunity as described above with the legal assurance that\\n       such testimony will not be used against Jose G. Delacruz in any potential future case\\n       against Jose G. Delacruz. I, Keith E. Schroeder, District Attorney, condition this grant of\\n       use immunity as described on the condition that the testimony of Jose G. Delacruz must\\n       be truthful.\"\\n                                                    3\\n       Delacruz argued that the grant of immunity did not preclude his invocation of\\nFifth Amendment rights because his aggravated robbery conviction was then on appeal\\nand because the written grant of immunity did not protect him from federal prosecution.\\nThe trial judge, Honorable Timothy J. Chambers, took the matter under advisement.\\n\\n       In the interim, the United States Attorney for the District of Kansas, Barry R.\\nGrissom, sent a letter to the district attorney stating that Grissom was familiar with the\\nfacts surrounding Delacruz\\' case and that while the letter did not act as a \"formal grant of\\nimmunity,\" no federal prosecution against Delacruz was warranted or would be\\nforthcoming for his involvement in the murder of Haines. Grissom opined that the federal\\nprosecution of Delacruz would violate the Department of Justice\\'s Petite policy. See\\nPetite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529, 530, 80 S. Ct. 450, 4 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1960) (a\\nfederal trial following a state prosecution for the same conduct generally barred).\\n\\n\\n       Judge Chambers then issued an order stating: \"K.S.A. 22-3415 confers upon the\\nDistrict Attorney the authority to grant use and derivative immunity. Written immunity\\nhas been granted by the District Attorney to Jose Delacruz. Therefore, Jose Delacruz will\\nbe compelled to testify in the trial of the above captioned matter.\" (Emphasis added.) The\\ndistrict court apparently did not address the fact that the written document purported to\\ngrant only use immunity. See Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 453-54, 92 S. Ct.\\n1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212, reh. denied 408 U.S. 931 (1972) (mere use immunity insufficient\\nprotection under Fifth Amendment; use and derivative use immunity coextensive with\\nconstitutional privilege against self-incrimination).\\n\\n\\n       Delacruz appeared before Judge Chambers three times during Waller\\'s trial and,\\nupon advice of counsel, refused the judge\\'s order to testify. Judge Chambers set a jury\\ntrial on the question of whether Delacruz was in direct criminal contempt of court for\\n                                              4\\nrefusing to testify at Waller\\'s trial. Meanwhile, Waller was convicted of first-degree\\nfelony murder and aggravated kidnapping without Delacruz\\' testimony. See State v.\\nWaller, 299 Kan. 707, 328 P.3d 1111 (2014) (affirming convictions and sentences).\\nDelacruz\\' contempt case was reassigned to the Honorable Joseph L. McCarville III.\\n\\n\\n       The State then filed an accusation of contempt, charging Delacruz with three\\ncounts of criminal contempt based on the theory that each time he appeared before Judge\\nChambers and refused to testify constituted a separate contemptuous act. The State\\ncomplained that Delacruz\\' refusal to testify made him unavailable for cross-examination,\\nrendered his video recorded statements inadmissible, and precluded the State from\\nexplaining to the jury why Delacruz was not called as a witness. The State asked for\\nconsecutive sentences of 36 months for each act of contempt, for a controlling sentence\\nof 108 months in prison, to be served consecutively to Delacruz\\' 83-month prison\\nsentence for aggravated robbery.\\n\\n\\n       But when Delacruz appeared before Judge McCarville on May 23, 2011, the judge\\nrecited a different accusation of contempt to Delacruz. The court had sua sponte drafted a\\ncontempt accusation that alleged that Delacruz had committed one act of contempt for\\nfailing to comply with an order of the court \"to appear and testify under oath as a\\nwitness.\" Judge McCarville informed Delacruz that he would not impose a prison\\nsentence greater than the State\\'s recommendation of 108 months. Delacruz pled not guilty\\nand the matter was set for trial.\\n\\n\\n       On the morning scheduled for trial, Judge McCarville denied Delacruz\\' motion to\\ndismiss based upon the claim that Judge Chambers\\' order to testify had violated Delacruz\\'\\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Thereafter, Delacruz waived his right\\nto a jury trial and the case was submitted to Judge McCarville on stipulated facts. After\\nconsidering arguments, Judge McCarville stated,\\n                                             5\\n       \"There is really no doubt that Mr. Delacruz didn\\'t comply with a direct order from\\n       District Judge Timothy J. Chambers, Division II, to testify in the Anthony Waller case\\n       and based upon my previous rulings there is no reasonable basis for him to have claimed\\n       the right not to testify under the Fifth Amendment so his refusal to testify was unlawful,\\n       was willful, was intentional and felonious and occurred here in Reno County in this court.\\n       The Court finds the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of felony criminal\\n       contempt of court as alleged in the accusation.\"\\n\\n\\n       After finding Delacruz guilty of direct criminal contempt, Judge McCarville\\nproceeded to sentencing. The State adhered to its 108-month sentencing recommendation,\\nnotwithstanding the district court\\'s dismissal of two counts of the State\\'s original\\naccusation in contempt. Delacruz asked for a six-month sentence.\\n\\n\\n       Before pronouncing sentence, Judge McCarville endeavored to provide the\\nreasoning behind his decision, albeit the court might have overlooked that it was the\\nState, not the defendant, that had sought to compel Delacruz\\' testimony. The court\\nexplained:\\n\\n\\n       \"The question here is not, this is not a case where we\\'re talking about somebody not\\n       taking their hat off or saying a bad word or not standing to address the Court or\\n       interrupting another attorney where those things are somewhat disruptive and do not lead\\n       to creation of the kind of atmosphere that we need to have in order for people to feel that\\n       when they come to court they can present, they can give their, they can present their case\\n       and witnesses can come to court and testify without having intimidation going in the\\n       courtroom or disruption or annoyance or disturbance. Those kind of things, that\\'s, in my\\n       opinion, are a little on a different level and a different plane. What we have in this case is\\n       an attack against the whole, the very essence of the judicial process.\\n\\n\\n               \"The reason that we\\'re talking about celebrating Veteran\\'s Day tomorrow,\\n       thousands and thousands of veterans have sacrificed their life to preserve our way of life;\\n\\n                                                     6\\nthe most, in my opinion the most important of which is to have everyone treated the\\nsame, that in courts doesn\\'t matter who you are you have the same rights. Doesn\\'t matter\\nwho you are, you\\'re treated with the same respect and dignity and it doesn\\'t matter who\\nyou are if you\\'re the poorest person with the most depraved background, if you have a\\nwitness that you want to have testify . . . that has relevant and admissible evidence in\\nyour case then you have the right to have that person brought to court and compelled to\\ntestify. Defendants charged with murder or other heinous crimes have the right to expect\\nthat if they have a witness that\\'s going to help present their defense that the Court will\\nhave the power to bring that person in and make them testify in order to help them prove\\ntheir innocence and what Mr. Delacruz has done is to say well, maybe not so fast. It\\ndoesn\\'t apply when I decide that I\\'m not going to be the witness.\\n\"What I need to know is okay, what is a sufficient sentence to cause a person in\\nMr. Delacruz\\'s position to decide that he\\'d rather testify and take his chances with\\nwhatever repercussions there might be that his attorneys tell him about. What is enough\\nyears or months to get him to say I\\'m going to take the stand, I\\'m going to testify because\\nI do not want to degrade the authority of the Court. It\\'s certainly not six months. It\\ncertainly has to be a number of years. It doesn\\'t matter whether Mr. Delacruz received an\\n83-month sentence or a life sentence, you know, because we\\'re not talking about his\\nsentence for the crime that he was convicted of. We\\'re talking about what he did in this\\ncontempt.\\n        \"What does this do to the dignity and the authority of the Court? I believe that I\\nhave a duty to, under Canon One and Canon Two under the [Code] of Judicial Conduct to\\nmaintain the authority and dignity of the Court and it\\'s not whether the attorney general\\ncame here. The attorney general would be assisting the Court by presenting evidence and\\nmaking arguments to assist the Court in figuring out the Court\\'s duty but the duty to\\npunish for contempt of court is not an executive branch function. It\\'s a duty that the Court\\nhas as a part of the essence of what a court is. We are [a] separate and co-equal branch of\\ngovernment and our purpose is to make sure that all parties have a tribunal in which they\\nhave access to compulsory process that\\'s effective. I don\\'t have anything to suggest that\\nany sentence less than 108 months would be sufficient to charge the Court\\'s\\nresponsibility. I realize that\\'s more than he got for the robbery but this is more serious\\n\\n                                              7\\n       than robbery. This is an attack against our judicial system. This is more serious than\\n       armed robbery what you did, Mr. Delacruz . . . .\"\\n\\n\\n       Judge McCarville then sentenced Delacruz to 108 months in prison, to be served\\nconsecutive to the 83-month sentence for his aggravated robbery conviction. The\\nsubsequently filed journal entry recited that the court \"finds [Delacruz] guilty beyond a\\nreasonable doubt of Direct Criminal Contempt of Court, pursuant to K.S.A. 20-1203\" and\\nthat Delacruz would serve 108 months in prison consecutive to his 83-month sentence for\\naggravated robbery. The order further noted that Delacruz had waived his right to a jury\\ntrial and the matter proceeded to a bench trial on stipulated facts.\\n\\n\\n       On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the contempt conviction and sentence.\\nSee State v. Delacruz, 52 Kan. App. 2d 153, 172, 364 P.3d 557 (2015) (Delacruz II). The\\npanel rejected Delacruz\\' argument that he validly exercised his Fifth Amendment right to\\nrefuse to testify, opining that his claim that he was not immune from federal prosecution\\nlacked merit under In re Birdsong, 216 Kan. 297, 532 P.2d 1301 (1975). Delacruz II, 52\\nKan. App. 2d at 158-61. Moreover, the panel held that Delacruz had failed to establish\\nthat his testimony might form the basis for a violation of federal law, as required by the\\nplain language of K.S.A. 22-3415(c). While acknowledging that the letter from the U.S.\\nAttorney was not a formal grant of immunity, the panel declared that the letter clearly\\nstated that no federal prosecution would be forthcoming. 52 Kan. App. 2d at 1661.\\nWith respect to the length of the sentence, the panel held that the trial court did not\\nabuse its discretion in imposing the 108-month sentence, noting that the factors for\\ndetermining an appropriate sentence for criminal contempt set forth in United States v.\\nMine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 303, 67 S. Ct. 677, 91 L. Ed. 884 (1947), supported the\\nsentence imposed. 52 Kan.

See Kaelter v. Sokol, 301 Kan. 247, 247, 340\\nP.3d 1210 (2015); State v. J.D.H., 48 Kan. App. 2d 454, 458, 294 P.3d 343, rev. denied\\n297 Kan. 1251 (2013) (appellate court has duty to question jurisdiction on own\\ninitiative). The parties were notified prior to oral arguments to be prepared to address the\\nfollowing issue: Whether the district court\\'s journal entry for direct contempt failed to\\ncomply with the written record requirement of K.S.A. 20-1203, rendering the contempt\\norder void for lack of jurisdiction.\\n\\nTRUE\\tSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\tStandard of Review\\n\\n       Whether jurisdiction exists is a question of law over which this court\\'s scope of\\nreview is unlimited. State v. Dull, 302 Kan. 32, 61, 351 P.3d 641 (2015). Here, the\\njurisdictional question involves an interpretation of K.S.A. 20-1203; statutory\\ninterpretation is subject to unlimited review. State v. Collins, 303 Kan. 472, 473-74, 362\\nP.3d 1098 (2015).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             9\\nTRUE\\tANALYSIS\\tAnalysis\\n\\n       A district court\\'s power to impose sanctions for contempt of court is regulated by\\nstatute. \"No inherent power to punish for contempt exists independent of K.S.A. 20-1201\\net seq.\" State v. Jenkins, 263 Kan. 351, 352, 950 P.2d 1338 (1997). \"Thus, to impose a\\nsanction against a contemnor, a court must follow the procedural requirements of K.S.A.\\n20-1201 et seq.\" In re M.R., 272 Kan. 1335, 1341, 38 P.3d 694 (2002).\\n\\n\\n       In this case, the district court\\'s journal entry recites: \"The Court finds the\\nDefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of Direct Criminal Contempt of Court,\\npursuant to K.S.A. 20-1203.\" Consequently, the district court was required to follow the\\nprocedural requirements set forth in K.S.A. 20-1203 as a condition precedent to imposing\\na sanction on Delacruz. That statute provides:\\n\\n\\n               \"That a direct contempt may be punished summarily, without written accusation\\n       against the person arraigned, but if the court or judge in chambers shall adjudge [the\\n       accused] guilty [of direct contempt] a judgment shall be entered of record, in which shall\\n       be specified the conduct constituting such contempt, with a statement of whatever defense\\n       or extenuation the accused offered thereto, and the sentence of the court thereon.\"\\n       (Emphasis added.)\\n\\n\\n       The journal entry in this case, filed on December 1, 2011, merely recited that the\\ndistrict court \"deliberates on the stipulation of facts, exhibits, applicable law and\\narguments of counsel\" and \"finds [Delacruz] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of Direct\\nCriminal Contempt of Court, pursuant to K.S.A. 20-1203.\" In other words, the recorded\\njudgment of the court failed to specify the conduct constituting contempt and failed to\\nstate the defense or extenuation offered by the accused, both of which were statutorily\\nrequired under the contempt authority that Judge McCarville chose to utilize.\\n\\n\\n                                                   10\\n       In Harsch v. Miller, 288 Kan. 280, 200 P.3d 467 (2009), we emphasized the\\nimportance of a district court properly recording a statute-compliant judgment of\\ncontempt when utilizing K.S.A. 20-1203 as the contempt authority. There, the district\\ncourt found plaintiff\\'s attorney in direct contempt of court under K.S.A. 20-1203 for\\nfailing to appear for trial, in contravention of a direct court order for the attorney to be\\npresent. Although the attorney had clearly and explicitly told the district court why the\\nattorney believed he should not have to appear for the trial, the \"journal entry contain[ed]\\nno reference as to why [the attorney] failed to appear, i.e., \\'a statement of whatever\\ndefense or extenuation [the attorney] offered.\\'\" The Harsch court held that the failure to\\ninclude K.S.A. 20-1203\\'s required content in the journal entry of contempt was a fatal\\njurisdictional defect that voided the direct contempt order, and the presence of the\\nrequisite information elsewhere in the record on appeal \"cannot cure the defect caused by\\n[its] absence in the journal entry.\" 288 Kan. at 295; cf. Padron v. Lopez, 289 Kan. 1089,\\n1106, 220 P.3d 345 (2009) (failure to comply with procedural requirements of indirect\\ncontempt statute K.S.A. 20-1204a is jurisdictional).\\n\\n\\n       Harsch cited Jenkins, where this court discussed the compulsory statutory\\nprocedure for direct contempt:\\n\\n\\n       \"K.S.A. 20-1203 provides for summary punishment, but requires that a written judgment\\n       be entered, specifying the contemptuous conduct, defense or extenuating circumstances,\\n       and the sentence imposed. Failure to comply with 20-1203 is jurisdictional. See In re\\n       Gambrell, 160 Kan. 620, 623, 164 P.2d 122 (1945), reh. denied 161 Kan. 4, 165 P.2d 760\\n       (1946). . . .\\n\\n\\n                \"Direct contempt orders have been held void for either failure to specify the\\n       conduct constituting the contempt or to state any defense or extenuation offered by the\\n       accused. See, e.g., State v. Flanagan, 19 Kan. App. 2d 528, 533, 873 P.2d 195 (1994).\"\\n       (Emphasis added.) Jenkins, 263 Kan. at 357.\\n\\n\\n                                                   11\\n       Likewise, in State v. Williams, 28 Kan. App. 2d 97, 11 P.3d 1187 (2000), the\\ndistrict court\\'s journal entry memorializing the sentencing hearing for a prospective juror\\nfound in direct contempt under K.S.A. 20-1203 failed to state the defenses or extenuating\\ncircumstances offered by the juror. When the prospective juror argued on appeal that the\\ncontempt order was void, the State countered with the argument that \"the purpose of the\\nrequirement of K.S.A. 20-1203 for a more detailed journal entry is to ensure a proper\\nrecord for appellate review and that the hearing transcript\\'s recording of [the prospective\\njuror\\'s] statement in her defense eliminates the need for such a journal entry in this case.\"\\n28 Kan. App. 2d at 101. The Court of Appeals panel rejected that argument, declaring\\nthat \"[t]he fact that we have access to a transcript of [the] sentencing hearing does not\\nexcuse the district court\\'s obligations under K.S.A. 20-1203.\" 28 Kan. App. 2d at 102.\\n\\n\\n       Granted, K.S.A. 20-1203\\'s requirement of a judgment of record that specifies the\\ncontemptuous conduct and the accused\\'s defense or extenuation is preceded by statutory\\nlanguage that authorizes a summary punishment for a direct contempt without the need\\nfor a written accusation. One might presume the Legislature intended K.S.A. 20-1203\\'s\\nwritten judgment of record requirement to serve the purpose normally served by a written\\naccusation of contempt. And, in this case there were written accusations of contempt\\nfrom both the prosecutor and the presiding judge, and Delacruz was afforded the\\nopportunity for a trial on those accusations with counsel to represent his interests.\\nPerhaps more importantly, this court has recently revisited the notion of subject\\nmatter jurisdiction in the context of using that label for due process violations or\\nprocedural infirmities. See, e.g., State v. Dunn, 304 Kan. 773, 811, 375 P.3d 332 (2016)\\n(overruling long-standing precedent by holding that defective charging documents do not\\ndeprive state courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate criminal cases); State v.\\nFord, 302 Kan. 455, 465, 353 P.3d 1143 (2015) (disapproving of precedent that had\\n                                              12\\nreferred to procedural errors in the determination of defendant\\'s competency to stand trial\\nas depriving the district court of jurisdiction); cf. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500,\\n511, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006) (criticizing \"drive-by jurisdictional\\nrulings\" where courts fail to distinguish between subject matter jurisdiction and other\\ntypes of error); Sperry v. McKune, 305 Kan. 469, 486, 384 P.3d 1003 (2016) (citing to\\nChelf v. State, 46 Kan. App. 2d 522, 263 P.3d 852 [2011], for the proposition that the\\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies does not deprive district court of subject matter\\njurisdiction).But unfortunately, because Delacruz did not challenge the district court\\'s\\njurisdiction or argue how the process utilized by the district court failed to comply with\\nthe mandates of K.S.A. 20-1203, the parties did not flesh out how the area of the law\\ninvolved in this case fits within this court\\'s changing concepts of subject matter\\njurisdiction. Moreover, the answer on the merits is especially clear in this case. See\\nAlvarado v. Holder, 743 F.3d 271, 276 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding that a court may \"put\\naside ambiguous jurisdictional questions\" under a statute \"when precedent clearly dictates\\nthe result on the merits\"); Sherrod v. Breitbart, 720 F.3d 932, 936-37 (D.C. Cir. 2013)\\n(holding that a court may presume jurisdiction and reach the merits when the answer to\\nthe merits issue is especially clear); Starkey ex rel.

Accordingly, we will presume, without deciding, that the district\\ncourt in this instance did not lose jurisdiction to find Delacruz in direct contempt of court\\nthrough a deficient journal entry.\\n                                             13\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tFIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE AGAINST COMPULSORY SELF-INCRIMINATION\\n\\n       Delacruz has maintained from the beginning that he had a valid Fifth Amendment\\nright to refuse to testify because the immunity granted to him was not coextensive with\\nhis constitutional right against self-incrimination.

Hughes, 286 Kan. 1010, 1029, 191 P.3d 268 (2008).\\n\\nTRUE\\tANALYSIS\\tAnalysis\\n\\n       It is undisputed that Delacruz failed to obey a direct order from the district court\\nwhen he refused to testify at Waller\\'s trial. But \"the power to compel testimony is not\\nabsolute,\" and the most important exception to that power is the Fifth Amendment\\nprivilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441,\\n444, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972). Specifically, the Fifth Amendment to the\\nConstitution of the United States declares that \"[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any\\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\" See also Kansas Constitution Bill of\\nRights Â§ 10 (\"No person shall be a witness against himself . . . .\"); K.S.A. 60-425\\n                                                     14\\n(granting every natural person a privilege to refuse to disclose \"any matter that will\\nincriminate such person\"). The privilege afforded not only applies to a witness\\' answers\\nthat would directly support a criminal conviction but also embraces those answers which\\nwould furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a\\ncrime. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S. Ct. 814, 95 L. Ed. 1118 (1951).\\n\\n\\n       On the other hand, a witness who has no reasonable cause to fear incrimination\\ncannot invoke the right. Hoffman, 341 U.S. at 486. One manner in which the State can\\nremove the fear of incrimination and compel testimony is to grant the witness immunity\\nin return for the witness\\' testimony. But not all grants of immunity will satisfy the\\nconstraints of the right against self-incrimination. As our Court of Appeals noted over\\ntwo decades ago:\\n\\n\\n               \"\\'There are three recognized types of immunity: (1) \"transactional,\" (2) \"use and\\n       derivative use,\" and, (3) \"use.\" \"Transactional\" immunity protects the witness from\\n       prosecution for offenses to which the compelled testimony relates. This type of immunity\\n       is broader than the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and need not always\\n       be granted, although it does, of course, constitute adequate immunity. \"Use and\\n       derivative use\" immunity protects the witness from the use of compelled testimony and\\n       evidence derived therefrom. It is coextensive with the constitutional privilege against\\n       self-incrimination and is therefore a sufficient grant of immunity to compel self-\\n       incriminatory testimony. On the other hand, mere \"use\" immunity, which only prevents\\n       the prosecution from using the compelled testimony in any criminal proceeding, is not\\n       constitutionally adequate since it does not prevent prosecuting authorities from making\\n       derivative use of the fruits of a witness\\' compelled testimony by obtaining investigatory\\n       leads from it.\\'\" Cabral v. State, 19 Kan. App. 2d 456, 460-61, 871 P.2d 1285 (1994).\\n\\n\\n       Cabral cited to this court\\'s prior decision in State v. Durrant, 244 Kan. 522, 534,\\n769 P.2d 1174 (1989), which held:\\n\\n\\n                                                   15\\n       \"For a statutory grant of immunity to be coextensive with the privilege against self-\\n       incrimination, it must grant not only use immunity, or protection from the direct use of\\n       compelled incriminatory information, but also derivative-use immunity, which prohibits\\n       use of any such information for investigatory purposes leading to other evidence of\\n       criminal activity.\"\\n\\n\\nDurrant was consistent with the landmark case of Kastigar, which, as noted above, held\\nthat if the government wants to compel testimony from a witness claiming the Fifth\\nAmendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, it must grant the witness at\\nleast use and derivative use immunity, otherwise a citation in contempt must be reversed.\\nHere, the State expressly granted Delacruz mere use immunity. To reiterate, the\\nwritten document provided to Delacruz was entitled, \"GRANT OF USE IMMUNITY,\"\\nand stated in the body that Delacruz was being granted \"immunity from the use of any\\ntestimony given in the above-captioned matter on February 28, 2011 through March 9,\\n2011.\" The document went on to explain that the use immunity being granted meant that\\nDelacruz\\' testimony would not be used against him in any potential future case. The\\ndocument did not mention the use of any evidence that might be derived from the\\ncompelled testimony. As Kastigar explained, the derivative use component of a\\ncoextensive grant of immunity is important because it \"[bars] the use of any evidence\\nobtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.\"\\n406 U.S. at 460. The State\\'s grant of immunity to Delacruz plainly did not include this\\nimportant component.\\n\\n\\n       Curiously, the grant of immunity document refers to the statute dealing with\\nimmunities, K.S.A. 22-3415, which specifically refers to use and derivative use immunity\\nunder subsection (b)(2). But the immunity document does not purport to incorporate that\\nstatutory definition by reference; rather, it recites that the immunity is being granted\\n\"pursuant to the authority vested in me as District Attorney, by K.S.A. 22-3415(a) [and]\\n                                                   16\\n(c).\" Those subsections, (a) and (c), have nothing to do with the type of immunity being\\ngranted. In other words, no reasonable inference on the type of immunity being granted\\ncan be discerned from the statutory reference.\\n\\n\\n       To summarize, the State granted Delacruz use immunity; the use immunity\\ngranted was not coextensive with Delacruz\\' constitutional right against self-incrimination;\\ntherefore, Judge Chambers\\' order compelling Delacruz\\' testimony at the Waller trial\\nviolated Delacruz\\' constitutional right against self-incrimination and was unlawful.\\nConsequently, Judge McCarville\\'s ensuing order, finding Delacruz in direct contempt of\\ncourt for refusing to testify and sentencing him to a consecutive 108-month prison term,\\nwas likewise unlawful.\\n\\n\\n       Accordingly, we reverse Judge McCarville\\'s order of contempt and vacate the 108-\\nmonth sentence. We note this holding appears to require recomputing the \"sentence\\nbegins date\" for Delacruz with appropriate credit given on any sentence or sentences\\nremaining. See K.A.R. 44-6-138(c) (2017 Supp.) (requiring recomputing of sentence\\nbegins date when one or more sentences in an aggregated sentence are vacated).\\n\\n\\n                                             17\\n\\n\\n 03/02/2018\\n        IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TENNESSEE\\n                         AT NASHVILLE\\n                          Assigned on Briefs May 10, 2017\\n\\n         STATE OF TENNESSEE v.

Factual Background\\n\\n       The Appellant was indicted for violating an order declaring him to be a motor\\nvehicle habitual offender (MVHO), a Class E felony; failing to provide evidence of\\nfinancial responsibility, a Class C misdemeanor; and passing another vehicle in a no\\npassing zone, a Class C misdemeanor. See Tenn. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 55-10-616; 55-12-139;\\n55-8-121.\\n\\n       On September 11, 2015, the State filed a motion in limine asking the trial court to\\nprohibit the Appellant from collaterally attacking the validity of the MVHO order. Citing\\nState v. William Tony Wright, No. M2001-01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655\\n(Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, June 19, 2002), the State contended that any argument or\\ntestimony suggesting the Appellant had no notice of the MVHO order was misleading\\nbecause the Appellant had been convicted of violating the MVHO order on three prior\\noccasions; therefore, such argument or testimony was inadmissible.\\n\\n        On September 30, 2015, immediately prior to trial, the trial court granted the\\nStateâ\\x80\\x99s motion. Defense counsel informed the trial court that he did not plan to\\ncollaterally attack the MVHO order. Instead, the defense strategy was to show that the\\nState did not introduce proof the Appellant had notice of the MVHO order and that,\\naccordingly, the State could not prove the Appellant intentionally, knowingly, or\\nrecklessly violated the MVHO order. The State then suggested that the easiest way to\\nestablish the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s awareness of the MVHO order was to introduce proof of the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s prior convictions of violating the order. Defense counsel responded that the\\nState could prove the Appellant had notice of the order without informing the jury that\\nthe Appellant had prior convictions of the same crime, which were â\\x80\\x9cmore prejudicial than\\nprobative.â\\x80\\x9d The trial court warned that if the Appellant proceeded with the argument he\\ndid not have notice of the MVHO order, it would allow the State to rebut the claim by\\nintroducing â\\x80\\x9cdocuments regarding service of process and awareness of court dates.â\\x80\\x9d The\\nState again noted the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s three prior convictions of violating the MVHO order\\nand argued that because of those convictions, the Appellant was prohibited from asserting\\nhe had no notice of the order according to case law. The trial court agreed that the State\\ncould not â\\x80\\x9ctry the case with its hands behind its back like that,â\\x80\\x9d and reiterated its warning\\nthat if defense counsel raised the issue of notice, it would allow the State to rebut the\\ndefenseâ\\x80\\x99s claims. Nevertheless, the trial court stated that it would not allow the State to\\nintroduce proof of the prior convictions until the Appellant â\\x80\\x9copens that door.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n        At trial, Chapel Hill Police Officer Andrew Kon testified that at 9:40 p.m. on\\nTuesday, March 31, 2015, he was driving his marked patrol car north on Highway 31-A\\nin the area of Henry Horton Park when he saw a red Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was\\ntraveling southbound pass a blue Ford Expedition. Officer Kon saw the headlights of the\\nMonte Carlo two or three hundred yards in front of his car â\\x80\\x9ccoming towardâ\\x80\\x9d him. Officer\\nKon said that although it was dark, the double yellow line indicating it was a no passing\\nzone was clearly visible. Officer Kon made a U-turn and activated his patrol carâ\\x80\\x99s blue\\nlights to initiate a traffic stop.\\n\\n                                            -2-\\n        The red Monte Carlo stopped in a Dollar General Store parking lot. Officer Kon\\nparked and approached the Appellant, who was the driver. Officer Kon advised the\\nAppellant that he had been stopped for passing another vehicle in a no passing zone. He\\nasked for the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driverâ\\x80\\x99s license, automobile registration, and proof of\\ninsurance, but the Appellant did not produce the documents. Officer Kon requested the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s name and date of birth, then he conveyed the information he obtained to the\\npolice dispatcher. After receiving a response from the dispatcher, Officer Kon arrested\\nthe Appellant for driving on a revoked license, violating a MVHO order, failing to\\nprovide proof of financial responsibility, and improper passing. Officer Kon recalled that\\nother vehicles were on the roadway when the Appellant passed the Expedition.\\nOn cross-examination, Officer Kon acknowledged that the Appellant did not cause\\nan accident and that no one was injured.\\n\\n       Nicholas Kiefer testified that he was a deputy clerk in the Davidson County\\nCriminal Court Clerkâ\\x80\\x99s Office and that he was a â\\x80\\x9ckeeper of the records.â\\x80\\x9d From the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s file, Kiefer identified a certified copy of an â\\x80\\x9cOrder to Appear . . . in an\\nhabitual offender matter.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer explained that according to the order, the Appellant\\nwas ordered â\\x80\\x9cto appear before the criminal court on the 19th of January, 2005, to show\\ncause why he should not be declared an habitual traffic offender.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer said that on the\\nsecond page of the order was a â\\x80\\x9ccertificate of service from the deputy sheriff.â\\x80\\x9d\\nKiefer identified another order by the Davidson County Criminal Court, which\\nstated that the Appellant was declared to be an habitual traffic offender. The order,\\nwhich was dated January 20, 2005, prohibited the Appellant from driving for three years\\nand ordered that he surrender his license to the court. On the second page of the order\\nwas a signed certificate of service reflecting that a â\\x80\\x9ctrue and exact copyâ\\x80\\x9d of the order had\\nbeen â\\x80\\x9cmailed or hand-deliveredâ\\x80\\x9d to the Appellant â\\x80\\x9cand/orâ\\x80\\x9d his attorney.\\nKiefer also identified a â\\x80\\x9ccertified copy of what we call a file jacket. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the front\\nof the file that â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s the front of what would be a criminal case file.â\\x80\\x9d He explained that\\nâ\\x80\\x9conly two specific clerksâ\\x80\\x9d in the office made notations on the front of the file jacket. The\\ngrand jury clerk wrote the case number, the division assignment, and the reason for the\\ncase. The â\\x80\\x9cjudgeâ\\x80\\x99s in-court clerkâ\\x80\\x9d wrote the date of the docket and â\\x80\\x9cnotations similar to\\nwhat would be on a minute entry.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer examined the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s file jacket and\\nnoticed that the first date listed was January 19, 2005. Kiefer said, â\\x80\\x9cThe notation for that\\nday states that the [Appellant], Mr. William Hanson, was served and that the case was\\nreset.â\\x80\\x9d The next date listed was January 20, 2005, which was the same date the MVHO\\norder was entered.\\n\\n        On cross-examination, Kiefer acknowledged that he began working in the clerkâ\\x80\\x99s\\noffice in 2011 and that he was not present for any of the 2005 court proceedings.\\n                                            -3-\\n        Glendora Graves testified that she was a district manager with the Tennessee\\nDepartment of Safety and Homeland Security. Through her employment, she had access\\nto driving histories. In preparation for trial, she accessed the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving history,\\nwhich included a January 20, 2005 order declaring the Appellant to be a MVHO. The\\norder resulted in the revocation of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s license. Graves stated that the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges were never restored and that the order was in effect on the\\nday of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s arrest.\\nOn cross-examination, Graves acknowledged that the branch of the Department of\\nSafety and Homeland Security which was responsible for maintaining driving records\\nwas located in Nashville. She further acknowledged that she did not maintain the driving\\nrecords. She also acknowledged that sometimes a driving record contained incorrect\\ninformation but that it did not happen often.\\nOn redirect examination, Graves asserted that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record had\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbeen certified as true and accurate by Susan Lowe of the financial responsibility\\ndivision.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n       The jury convicted the Appellant as charged. On appeal, the Appellant contends\\nthat the trial court erred by granting the Stateâ\\x80\\x99s motion to prohibit the Appellant from\\ncollaterally attacking the motor vehicle habitual offender order, by limiting the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s\\nclosing argument, and by admitting the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record into evidence through\\nStateâ\\x80\\x99s witness from the Department of Safety and Homeland Security. The Appellant\\nalso contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for violating an\\norder declaring him to be a motor vehicle habitual offender.\\n\\nTRUE\\tANALYSIS\\tII. Analysis\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tA. Collateral Attack on MVHO Order\\n\\n       As his first issue, the Appellant contends that he â\\x80\\x9cmakes a good faith argument for\\n[a] change in the law thus allowing this case to be remanded to allow collateral attack on\\nthe Davidson County [MVHO] Order.â\\x80\\x9d In the trial court, the Appellant repeatedly\\nasserted that he was not collaterally attacking the MVHO order and was instead claiming\\nthat the State failed to prove he received notice of the order and thus failed to prove he\\nviolated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. On appeal, however, the\\nAppellant concedes that he is collaterally attacking the MVHO order.1 The Appellant\\ncontends that the trial court misconstrued State v. William Tony Wright, No. M2001-\\n\\n        1\\n         We caution that â\\x80\\x9can appellant is bound by the evidentiary theory set forth at trial, and may not\\nchange theories on appeal.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Alder, 71 S.W.3d 299, 303 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001).\\n                                                  -4-\\n01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, June 19, 2002),\\nas authority to grant the Stateâ\\x80\\x99s motion in limine restricting collateral attack on the\\nMVHO order. He maintains that Wright did not stand for the proposition that a\\ndefendant could not collaterally attack an MVHO order. The Appellant did not cite any\\nother cases in support of his contention. The Appellant contends that the trial courtâ\\x80\\x99s\\nerroneous ruling limited his ability to argue that the State had failed to prove that the\\nAppellant knew about the MVHO order and, accordingly, that the Appellant could not\\nhave violated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.\\n\\n       This court has explained previously that â\\x80\\x9c[a] proceeding under the Motor Vehicle\\nHabitual Offender Act is civil in nature and therefore is governed by the Tennessee Rules\\nof Civil Procedure.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Malady, 952 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996). As\\nthe State notes, this court has held consistently that a defendant cannot collaterally attack\\nan order declaring him to be a MVHO. See Davis v. State, 793 S.W.2d 650, 651 (Tenn.\\nCrim. App. 1990); Everhart v. State, 563 S.W.2d 795, 797-98 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978);\\nState v. Tony Lynn Allen, No. M2007-00826-CCA-R3-CD, 2008 WL 2743882, at *3\\n(Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, July 15, 2008); State v. Nelson Keith Foster, No. E2001-\\n02976-CCA-RM-CD, 2002 WL 181359, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, Feb. 1,\\n2002); State v. Michael Samuel Eidson, No. 03C01-9711-CR-00506, 1999 WL 160944,\\nat *1 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Knoxville, Mar. 24, 1999). Instead, â\\x80\\x9cthe appropriate\\nprocedure for challenging a habitual [motor vehicle] offender order is to file a motion\\npursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Ernest Michael Turner,\\nNo. W2006-02661-CCA-R3-CD, 2008 WL 1700338, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Jackson,\\nApr. 4, 2008) (citing Bankston v. State, 815 S.W.2d 213, 216 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991)).We agree with the State that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s arguments regarding Wright are â\\x80\\x9cnot\\nentirely accurate.â\\x80\\x9d The Appellant contends that the defendant in Wright was allowed to\\ncollaterally attack the MVHO order. However, in Wright, the defendant pled guilty to\\nviolating an MVHO order. Wright, No. M2001-01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655,\\nat *1. Thereafter, he filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea, arguing that he was\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98legally innocentâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d of the violation because the order did not comply with Tennessee\\nRule of Civil Procedure 58. Id. Simultaneously, the defendant filed a motion\\nchallenging the MVHO order under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02. Id. at *2.\\nOn appeal, this court determined that the defendantâ\\x80\\x99s issues turned upon whether he was\\nentitled to relief under Rule 60.02 and, after consideration, held that â\\x80\\x9cthe trial court did\\nnot err in denying [the defendantâ\\x80\\x99s] motion for relief from the order declaring him to be a\\nmotor vehicle habitual offender.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at *4.\\n\\n      The record before us does not reflect that the Appellant ever filed a motion\\npursuant to Rule 60.02 challenging the MVHO order, and he has not filed such a motion\\nin the instant case. Moreover, the State did not argue that Wright stood for the\\nproposition that an MVHO order could not be collaterally attacked; instead, the State\\n                                            -5-\\ncited Wright to support the proposition that a defendant who had pled guilty to violating\\nthe MVHO order previously consequently has notice of the order. We agree. The\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s arguments are unavailing.\\n\\nTRUE\\tARGUMENT\\tB. Closing Argument\\n\\n        The Appellant next contends that the trial court erred by limiting defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s\\nability to argue during closing argument that the State introduced no proof the Appellant\\nhad notice of the MVHO order and that, accordingly, he could not have intentionally,\\nknowingly, or recklessly violated the order. The State responds that the Appellant is not\\nentitled to relief on this issue.\\n\\n        It is well-established that closing argument is an important tool for both parties\\nduring a trial; thus, counsel is generally given wide latitude during closing argument, and\\nthe trial court is granted wide discretion in controlling closing arguments. See State v.\\nCarruthers, 35 S.W.3d 516, 577-78 (Tenn. 2000) (appendix). â\\x80\\x9cNotwithstanding such,\\narguments must be temperate, based upon the evidence introduced at trial, relevant to the\\nissues being tried, and not otherwise improper under the facts or law.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Goltz,\\n111 S.W.3d 1, 5 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2003).\\n\\n       The record reflects that during closing argument, defense counsel acknowledged\\nthat the State had shown the jury the MVHO order but argued that it was required also to\\nprove that the Appellant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly violated the order.\\nDefense counsel told the jury that all three mental states â\\x80\\x9crequire [the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s]\\nknowledge. That he knew this [order] existed.â\\x80\\x9d Defense counsel contended, however,\\nthe State presented no witnesses who testified that they saw the order being given to the\\nAppellant or that he was in court the day the order was issued. The State objected to\\ndefense counselâ\\x80\\x99s argument as a collateral attack on the MVHO order after the proof was\\nclosed. Defense counsel responded that he was not arguing that the order was invalid.\\nThe trial court said that it was being â\\x80\\x9cliberalâ\\x80\\x9d with defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s argument but\\ncautioned that if defense counsel went â\\x80\\x9ctoo far,â\\x80\\x9d it would let the State respond â\\x80\\x9cwithin the\\nconfines of the proof.â\\x80\\x9d The trial court agreed that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s prior convictions were\\nnot part of the proof; nevertheless, the court observed that defense counsel was\\nattempting to â\\x80\\x9csand bagâ\\x80\\x9d the State by claiming the Appellant had no notice of the MVHO\\norder after the proof was closed in order to render the State unable to rebut the claim.\\n\\n       Defense counsel maintained that the State could have introduced the minutes or\\ntranscript of the MVHO hearing or called the district attorney who prosecuted that case to\\nprove the Appellant had knowledge of the MVHO order. However, the trial court\\nresponded that the State was not required to go to such lengths to prove the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s\\nknowledge of the order and that it was â\\x80\\x9cdis[i]ngenuousâ\\x80\\x9d for defense counsel to argue that\\nthe Appellant did not have notice of the MVHO order. The trial court allowed defense\\n                                           -6-\\ncounsel to argue â\\x80\\x9cabout what is on the orderâ\\x80\\x9d but refused to let him argue that the\\nAppellant did not have notice of the order. The court cautioned that if defense counsel\\npersisted in his argument, the court might â\\x80\\x9chave to craft a specific instruction,â\\x80\\x9d noting\\nthat the standard MVHO instruction did not explain that the State did not â\\x80\\x9chave to prove\\na negative. They have to prove there was an order and he drove.â\\x80\\x9d\\nInitially, we note that the Appellant failed to cite any authority in support of his\\nargument that the trial court erred by limiting his closing argument. Generally, â\\x80\\x9c[i]ssues\\nwhich are not supported by argument, citation to authorities, or appropriate references to\\nthe record will be treated as waived in this court.â\\x80\\x9d Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b); see\\nTenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7).\\nFurther, the Appellant argues that the trial court warned defense counsel that if he\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccontinued this sort of argument, that the Court would allow the State to present to the\\njury evidence to show the [Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s] knowledge of the [MVHO] order.â\\x80\\x9d The\\nAppellant provided no citation to the record where the court issued the foregoing\\nwarning. Our review of the record reveals that the trial court issued no such warning;\\ninstead, the trial court told the Appellant that it would allow the State to â\\x80\\x9cdo what they\\nhave got to do within the confines of the proofâ\\x80\\x9d and that the trial court would fashion a\\nspecial jury instruction to inform the jury that the State did not have to prove the\\nAppellant was in court on the day the MVHO order was issued.\\n\\n       Moreover, once defense counsel continued his closing argument, he argued to the\\njury that the certificate of service on the second page of the MVHO order was â\\x80\\x9cpro\\nformaâ\\x80\\x9d and did not specify the method in which the order may have been delivered to the\\nAppellant. Defense counsel also argued that Kiefer did not work at the court at the time\\nthe order was issued and therefore could not testify specifically about how the Appellant\\nreceived the order, whether it was mailed or hand-delivered, and could not assert that the\\nAppellant definitively had received the order. Although defense counsel was allowed to\\nmake this argument, it was inappropriate and an attempt to collaterally attack the\\nunderlying judgment. The Appellant is not entitled to relief on this issue.\\n\\nTRUE\\tTESTIMONY\\tC. Gravesâ\\x80\\x99s Testimony\\n\\n\\t       As his next issue, the Appellant argues that Graves was not qualified to testify\\nabout his driving record because she was not the keeper of the records at the Department\\nof Safety and Homeland Security and that the driving record was not a self-authenticating\\ndocument. He complains that the trial court required the Appellant to choose between\\nallowing Graves to testify that his driving privileges had not been reinstated since the\\nMVHO order or allowing the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s redacted driving history to be entered into\\nevidence as a self-authenticating document. The State responds that the Appellant has\\nwaived the issue by failing to include the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record in the appellate\\nrecord for our review. In the alternative, the State argues that the trial court did not err by\\nlimiting Gravesâ\\x80\\x99s testimony to whether the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges had been\\nreinstated. We agree with the State.\\nDuring a jury-out hearing, the State announced that it intended to call Glendora\\nGraves as the keeper of the records of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security.\\nShe said that her department was responsible for issuing driverâ\\x80\\x99s licenses and keeping\\ninformation regarding driverâ\\x80\\x99s histories. Graves asserted that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving\\nhistory reflected that his driverâ\\x80\\x99s license had been revoked and had never been reinstated.\\n\\nTRUE\\tSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\tII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\\n\\n       Defense counsel objected to Graves being allowed to testify, arguing that although\\nshe could access the records, she was not the keeper of the records. The trial court asked\\nwhether the records were self-authenticating. The State responded that the records were\\nself-authenticating.\\n\\n        We are unable to address any of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s concerns regarding whether the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record was self-authenticating because the Appellant failed to include\\nthe driving record in the appellate record for our review. The Appellant carries the\\nburden of ensuring that the record on appeal conveys a fair, accurate, and complete\\naccount of what has transpired with respect to those issues that are the bases of appeal.\\nTenn. R. App. P. 24(b); see also Thompson v. State, 958 S.W.2d 156, 172 (Tenn. Crim.\\nApp. 1997). â\\x80\\x9cIn the absence of an adequate record on appeal, this court must presume\\nthat the trial courtâ\\x80\\x99s rulings were supported by sufficient evidence.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Oody, 823\\nS.W.2d 554, 559 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991). Accordingly, the Appellant is not entitled to\\nrelief on this issue.\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tD. Sufficiency of the Evidence\\n\\n       As his final issue, the Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\\nsustaining his conviction for violating the MVHO order, asserting that the State failed to\\nprove that he violated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. The State\\nresponds that the proof was sufficient. On appeal, a jury conviction removes the\\npresumption of the appellantâ\\x80\\x99s innocence and replaces it with one of guilt, so that the\\nappellant carries the burden of demonstrating to this court why the evidence will not\\nsupport the juryâ\\x80\\x99s findings. See State v. Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). The\\nappellant must establish that no reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential\\nelements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.\\n307, 319 (1979); Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e).\\n\\n      Accordingly, on appeal, the State is entitled to the strongest legitimate view of the\\nevidence and all reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom. See State v.\\nWilliams, 657 S.W.2d 405, 410 (Tenn. 1983). In other words, questions concerning the\\n                                             -8-\\ncredibility of witnesses and the weight and value to be given the evidence, as well as all\\nfactual issues raised by the evidence, are resolved by the trier of fact, and not the\\nappellate courts. See State v. Pruett, 788 S.W.2d 559, 561 (Tenn. 1990).\\n\\n       The guilt of a defendant, including any fact required to be proven, may be\\npredicated upon direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or a combination of both direct\\nand circumstantial evidence. See State v. Pendergrass, 13 S.W.3d 389, 392-93 (Tenn.\\nCrim. App. 1999). Even though convictions may be established by different forms of\\nevidence, the standard of review for the sufficiency of that evidence is the same whether\\nthe conviction is based upon direct or circumstantial evidence. See State v. Dorantes,\\n331 S.W.3d 370, 379 (Tenn. 2011).\\n\\nTRUE\\tANALYSIS                        V. ANALYSIS\\n\\n        This court previously has observed that in order to sustain a conviction under\\nTennessee Code Annotated section 55-10-616(a), the State must â\\x80\\x9cprove (1) that [the\\nA]ppellant was subject to a judgment or order prohibiting him from operating a motor\\nvehicle and (2) that he operated a motor vehicle while that judgment or order was in\\neffect.â\\x80\\x9d State v.

STANDARDS OF REVIEW\\n\\n        In the light most favorable to the State, the proof adduced at trial revealed that on\\nthe evening of March 31, 2015, Officer Kon was driving north on Highway 31-A when\\nhe saw a red Monte Carlo pass a blue Ford Expedition in a no passing zone. Officer Kon\\nstopped the Monte Carlo, which was being driven by the Appellant. The Appellant was\\nunable to produce his driverâ\\x80\\x99s license, automobile registration, or proof of insurance.\\nDavidson County Criminal Court records reflected that on January 19, 2005, the court\\nissued an order for the Appellant to appear in an habitual traffic offender matter. On the\\norder was a certificate of service from the deputy sheriff. The court records also reflected\\nthat on January 20, 2005, the court issued an order declaring the Appellant an habitual\\ntraffic offender. The second page of the order reflected that a copy of the order was to be\\nsent to the Appellant or his attorney and also reflected a signed certificate of service. The\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges were never restored. We conclude that the foregoing\\nevidence was sufficient to sustain the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s conviction of violating an MVHO\\norder.\\n\\nTRUE\\tCONCLUSION\\tIII. Conclusion\\n\\n      In sum, we conclude that the Appellant is not entitled to relief on any of his issues.\\nThe judgments of the trial court are affirmed.\\n\\n\\n\\n      A Lincoln County Grand Jury indicted Appellant, Timothy Robinson, of\\n\\nfirst-degree sodomy (victim less than twelve years old), incest (victim less than\\n\\ntwelve years old), and use of a minor in a sexual performance (victim less than\\n\\ntwelve years old). A Lincoln Circuit Court jury found him guilty of all three\\n\\ncharges and recommended sentences of life imprisonment for sodomy, fifty\\n\\nyears\\' imprisonment for incest, and twenty years\\' imprisonment for use of a\\n\\nminor in a sexual performance. Appellant now appeals as a matter of right, Ky.\\n\\nConst. Â§ 110(2)(b), and raises the following issues: (1) he was unfairly\\n\\nprejudiced by the trial court\\'s joinder of his case with his brother\\'s, (2) the trial\\n\\ncourt erroneously admitted evidence of numerous bad acts, and (3) the trial\\n\\ncourt erred in ordering that his sentence in the case at bar be run\\n\\nconsecutively to a sentence he was already serving in a separate case.\\n\\nTRUE\\tBACKGROUND\\tI. BACKGROUND\\n\\n     Appellant lived in a two-bedroom mobile home with his wife, the couple\\'s\\n\\nseven children, and one of his step-daughters, Suzie. 1 Appellant\\'s brother,\\n\\nJames Matthew Robinson (Matt), visited Appellant\\'s home frequently, often\\n\\ndrinking beer with Appellant until both were intoxicated. Several witnesses\\n\\ntestified at trial that the events described below took place when Appellant and\\n\\nMatt got drunk.\\n\\n      Appellant and Matt were each charged with the first-degree sodomy of\\n\\nAppellant\\'s son, Sam, who was under the age of twelve at the time the abuse\\n\\noccurred. Appellant was also indicted for incest and use of a minor in a sexual\\n\\nperformanceâ\\x80\\x94both these counts related to his sodomy of Sam. The Grand\\n\\nJury indicted Matt of seven counts of use of a minor in a sexual performance\\n\\nand six counts of first-degree sexual abuse in a separate indictment. All of\\n\\nMatt\\'s charges concerned Appellant\\'s children and Suzie.\\n\\nTRUE\\tANALYSIS\\tII. ANALYSIS\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tA. Joinder\\n\\n\\n      Over Appellant\\'s objection and motion to sever, the trial court granted\\n\\nthe Commonwealth\\'s motion to consolidate the two indictments and heard the\\n\\nbrothers\\' cases jointly, as the two were \"alleged to have participated in the\\n\\nsame act or transaction . . . constituting an offense.\" RCr 6.20. All but one of\\n\\nWe have changed the names of the minors in this opinion.\\n\\n                                         2\\nMatt\\'s charges were brought in a separate indictment from Appellant\\'s,\\n\\nhowever, RCr 9.12 provides:\\n\\n      The court may order two (2) or more indictments, informations,\\n      complaints or uniform citations to be tried together if the offenses,\\n      and the defendants, if more than one (1), could have been joined in\\n      a single indictment, information, complaint or uniform citation.\\n      The procedure shall be the same as if the prosecution were under a\\n      single indictment, information, complaint or uniform citation.\\n\\n      Appellant argues that he was prejudiced by the joinder of his and Matt\\'s\\n\\ncases. Pursuant to RCr 8.31, lig it appears that a defendant or the\\n\\nCommonwealth is or will be prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants\\n\\nin an indictment, information, complaint or uniform citation or by joinder for\\n\\ntrial, the court shall order separate trials of counts, grant separate trials of\\n\\ndefendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires.\" As this Court\\n\\nrecently held, \"[w]e review the trial court\\'s denial of a motion to sever for abuse\\n\\nof discretion . . . and the burden is on the appellant to show that the denial\\n\\nwas in fact unfairly prejudicial.\" Peacher v. Commonwealth, 391 S.W.3d 821,\\n\\n834 (Ky. 2013) (citing Quisenberry v. Commonwealth, 336 S.W.3d 19 (Ky.\\n\\n2011)); see also Rearick v. Commonwealth, 858 S.W.2d 185, 187 (Ky. 1993)\\n\\n(\"We start with the general proposition that a trial court has broad discretion\\n\\nwith respect to joinder, and will not, be overturned absent a showing of\\nprejudice and clear abuse of discretion.\"); Rachel v. Commonwealth, 523\\nS.W.2d 395, 400 (Ky. 1975) (\"If upon the consideration of the case a trial judge\\n\\norders a joint trial, we cannot reverse unless we are clearly convinced that\\n\\nprejudice occurred and that the likelihood of prejudice was so clearly\\n\\n                                          3\\ndemonstrated to the trial judge as to make his failure to grant severance an\\n\\nabuse of discretion.\").\\n\\nAppellant and Matt did not present antagonistic defenses at trial and the\\n\\ntrial court admonished the jury any time testimony applied only to one of the\\n\\nbrothers. Accordingly, the trial court instructed the jury several times during\\n\\nthe course of the trial that the testimony of various witnesses would be\\n\\nconsidered only for purposes of Matt and had no bearing on Appellant\\'s case.\\n\\nWe have held \"[a] jury is presumed to follow an admonition to disregard\\n\\nevidence and the admonition thus cures any error.\" Johnson v.\\n\\nCommonwealth, 105 S.W.3d 430, 441 (Ky. 2003). The only argument Appellant\\n\\nmakes to this court to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trial\\n\\ncourt\\'s admonitions is that the jury recommended the maximum sentence for\\n\\neach of his charges and recommended that those sentences run consecutively\\n\\nto one another.Appellant points out that Matt was charged with thirteen counts\\n\\nunrelated to the sodomy charge for which both brothers were jointly indicted.\\n\\nHe insists that the testimony solely related to Matt\\'s sexual abuse and use of a\\n\\nminor in a sexual performance charges was often extremely inflammatory.\\n\\nSpecifically, Appellant claims that Matt was tried for an additional indictment\\n\\nof first-degree sodomy \"of a separate child in which [Appellant] was not alleged\\n\\nto have been involved.\" However, this claim is patently false. The only charge\\n\\nof first-degree sodomy against Matt tried jointly with Appellant\\'s case was the\\n\\n                                        4\\ncharge for which Appellant was also indicted: in which both Appellant and\\n\\nMatt were charged with sodomizing Appellant\\'s son, Sam.\\n\\n      Relying on our statement in Rearick v. Commonwealth, 858 S.W.2d 185,\\n\\n187 (Ky. 1993), that \"[a] significant factor in identifying such prejudice is the\\n\\nextent to which evidence of one offense would be admissible in a trial of the\\n\\nother offense,\" Appellant argues that because none of the evidence presented\\n\\nagainst Matt in the charges stemming from his second indictment would be\\n\\nadmissible in Appellant\\'s trial, this created sufficient prejudice. However, as\\n\\nstated above (and as Appellant acknowledges), we will not overturn the decision\\n\\nof the trial court absent a showing that it abused its discretion. \"The test for\\n\\nabuse of discretion is whether the trial judge\\'s decision was arbitrary,\\n\\nunreasonable, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles.\"\\n\\nCommonwealth v. English, 993 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Ky. 1999).\\n\\nAs to the brothers\\' sodomy charge, Sam testified in graphic detail about\\n\\nhis father and uncle anally raping him. Sam testified that his father had first\\n\\nsodomized him when he was in first or second grade. He went on to testify that\\n\\nwhen he was in third grade, his father and Matt took turns having sex with\\n\\nhim in the bathroom of the mobile home Sam lived in with his parents and\\n\\nseven siblings. When the Commonwealth asked what he meant by his\\n\\nstatement that Appellant and Matt had sex with him, Sam responded that he\\n\\nmeant that they stuck their penises in his butt. Clearly, so far as the charges\\n\\narising from Appellant and Matt\\'s sodomy of Sam, the brothers were \"alleged to\\n\\nhave participated in the same act or transaction . . . constituting an offense\"\\n\\n                                         5\\npursuant to RCr 6.20 and the cases were properly joined under our Rules.\\n\\nAppellant was not prejudiced by the joinder of his and Matt\\'s charges under\\n\\nthis indictment. All of the \"evidence of one offense would be admissible in a\\n\\ntrial of the other offense.\" Rearick, 858 S.W.2d at 187. Therefore, the trial\\n\\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant\\'s motion for severance\\n\\nof the charges included in the same indictment.The charges arising from Matt\\'s separate indictment are a bit more\\n\\nproblematic. Under that indictment, Matt was charged with six counts of first-\\n\\ndegree sexual abuse and seven counts of use of a minor in a sexual\\n\\nperformance. The alleged victims were six of Appellant\\'s children, including\\n\\nSam, and Appellant\\'s step-daughter, Suzie. In addition to Sam and Suzie,\\n\\nthree of Appellant\\'s other children testified about Matt touching them\\n\\ninappropriately, or about seeing Matt touch their siblings or step-sister\\n\\ninappropriately. While the evidence of these other charges would not have\\n\\nbeen admissible in Appellant\\'s trial, we have reviewed the trial record at length\\n\\nand are satisfied with the admonitions the trial court gave the jury. In each\\n\\ninstance, the jury was instructed to only consider the testimony as it related to\\n\\nMatt and not to use it against Appellant in any way. Appellant does not\\n\\nattempt to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trial court\\'s\\n\\nadmonitions.Appellant also complains that a statement a witness (Matt\\'s ex-girlfriend)\\n\\nmade prejudiced him. That witness testified that Matt \"would get around them\\n\\n[(Appellant\\'s children)] and always tell me that he was going to fuck them in the\\n\\n                                        6\\nass or make them suck his dick. And he would always say he always wanted a\\n\\nschool boy, he would fuck one eight to eighty.\" The jury was also admonished\\n\\nthat this testimony only concerned Matt and that it was not to use any of this\\n\\nwitness\\'s testimony against Appellant. We note again that \"[a] jury is\\n\\npresumed to follow an admonition to disregard evidence and the admonition\\n\\nthus cures any error.\" Johnson 105 S.W.3d at 441. \"Nor does [Appellant]\\n\\npresent any argument to rebut the presumption that the trial court\\'s\\n\\nadmonition cured the error,\" Mills v. Commonwealth, 996 S.W.2d 473, 485 (Ky.\\n\\n1999) overruled on other grounds by Padgett v. Commonwealth, 312 S.W.3d 336\\n\\n(Ky. 2010). As such, we hold that the trial court\\'s admonitions cured any error\\n\\nresulting from the joinder of Appellant\\'s and Matt\\'s indictments.\\n\\n      Furthermore, Appellant\\'s argument that the evidence should not have\\n\\nbeen admitted, as \"unless a collateral act has some direct relationship to the\\n\\ncharge being tried, its admission necessarily depends on the view that the\\n\\ndefendant\\'s character and predisposition are probative of his guilt,\" Rearick,\\n\\n858 S.W.2d at 187, is without merit. None of the complained of testimony was\\n\\nadmitted against Appellant; but, rather, it was admitted against Matt and the\\n\\njury was specifically directed not to use it in any way against Appellant.\\n\\n      As to Appellant\\'s contention that his sentence reflects the fact that\\n\\nevidence of his brother\\'s crimes prejudiced the jury against him, we point out\\n\\nthat the most inflammatory witness statements in the case would have come in\\n\\nas evidence in Appellant\\'s trial regardless of whether it was joined with his\\n\\nbrother\\'s. In addition to Sam\\'s testimony that his father sodomized him on at\\n\\n                                         7\\nleast two occasions in the bathroom of their home, Suzie (who had lived with\\n\\nAppellant since she was around eighteen months old) also testified that\\n\\nAppellant had anally raped her in the same bathroom described by Sam. (This\\n\\ntestimony will be discussed in more detail below.) While the evidence against\\n\\nMatt included testimony by several of the children that he had fondled their\\n\\nbreasts and/or genital areas inside or outside their clothing or exposed himself\\n\\nto the children or had the children disrobe for him, the trial court admonished\\n\\nthe jury not to consider this evidence against Appellant. We believe that the\\n\\nfact that two child witnesses testified that Appellant had anally raped themâ\\x80\\x94\\n\\nand the fact Appellant served as a father figure to both of themâ\\x80\\x94is enough to\\n\\naccount for the jury\\'s recommended sentence without accounting for any\\n\\nalleged prejudice.\\n\\n      We are not \"clearly convinced that prejudice occurred and that the\\n\\nlikelihood of prejudice was so clearly demonstrated to the trial judge as to\\n\\nmake his failure to grant severance an abuse of discretion.\" Rachel, 523\\n\\nS.W.2d at 400. Therefore, we affirm the trial court as to the joinder of\\n\\nAppellant and Matt\\'s trials.\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tB. Other Bad Acts Evidence\\n\\n      Appellant next alleges that the introduction of evidence of Appellant\\'s\\n\\nother bad acts constitutes reversible error. First, Appellant argues that Suzie\\'s\\n\\ntestimony about Appellant sodomizing her should not have been admitted.\\n\\nThis issue was preserved by contemporaneous objection at trial. Appellant also\\n\\nargues that other instances of other bad acts testimony should not have been\\n\\n\\n                                         8\\nadmitted at trial, though no objections were made regarding this evidence.\\n\\nThese unobjected-to instances include: Appellant\\'s daughter\\'s testimony that\\n\\nher father had sexually abused her, Sam\\'s testimony that Appellant had\\n\\nphysically abused him, and testimony of Appellant\\'s drug and alcohol use.\\n\\nAppellant argues that the trial court was on notice that such evidence should\\n\\nnot be admitted in spite of his failure to object and that we should treat these\\n\\nerrors as preserved. In the alternative, he requests that we review this\\n\\ntestimony for palpable error.\\n\\nTRUE\\tTESTIMONY\\t1. Suzie\\'s Testimony\\n\\n      Kentucky Rules of Evidence 404 deals with character evidence and\\n\\nevidence of other crimes. More specifically, KRE 404(b) provides:\\n\\n      (b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes,\\n      wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person\\n      in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however,\\n      be admissible:\\n\\n            (1) If offered for some other purpose, such as proof of\\n            motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\\n            knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident;\\n            or\\n\\n            (2) If so inextricably intertwined with other evidence\\n            essential to the case that separation of the two (2)\\n            could not be accomplished without serious adverse\\n            effect on the offering party.\\n\\nIn Bell v. Commonwealth, 875 S.W.2d 882, 889 (Ky. 1994), this Court stated\\n\\n\"trial courts must apply the rule cautiously, with an eye towards eliminating\\n\\nevidence which is relevant only as proof of an accused\\'s propensity to commit a\\n\\ncertain type of crime.\" We set out a three-prong test that should be followed in\\n\\ndetermining if KRE 404(b) evidence should have been excluded at trial: . (1) the\\n\\n                                         9\\nfirst factor goes to relevance and asks, \"[i]s the other crimes evidence relevant\\n\\nfor some purpose other than to prove the criminal disposition of the accused?,\"\\n\\nId.; (2) the second factor goes to probativeness and asks, \"[i]s evidence of the\\n\\nuncharged crime sufficiently probative of its commission by the accused to\\n\\nwarrant its introduction into evidence?,\" Id. at 890; and (3) the third factor goes\\n\\nto prejudice and asks, \"[d]oes the potential for prejudice from the use of other\\n\\ncrimes evidence substantially outweigh its probative value?,\"\\n\\nId. We review a trial court\\'s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.\\n\\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Thompson, 11 S.W.3d 575, 577 (Ky. 2000).\\n\\n      Before Suzie testified at trial, the jury was instructed that it could\\n\\nconsider the testimony for the limited purpose of Appellant\\'s pattern of\\n\\nconductâ\\x80\\x94and could not consider her testimony for any other purpose. Suzie\\n\\ntestified at trial that Appellant had sex with her. When asked exactly what\\n\\nAppellant did to her, she stated \"[p]ut his penis in my butt. He said that he\\n\\nwas cleaning it.\" Suzie had lived in the same house as Appellant from the time\\n\\nshe was eighteen months old until she was removed from the home at age\\n\\nfourteen. The described abuse happened sometime between the time she was\\n\\ntwelve and fourteen in the same bathroom Sam identified as the location of his\\n\\nabuse. The fact that Appellant had already pled guilty to sexually abusing\\n\\nSuzie and signed a written letter apologizing to her for said abuse was not\\n\\nadmitted at trial. The trial court admitted Suzie\\'s testimony, finding that it was\\n\\nrelevant and admissible as it established a pattern of conduct. Specifically, the\\n\\ntrial court looked at the Bell factors and found:\\n\\n                                         10\\n      [Suzie] lived in Appellant\\'s household since the time that she had\\n      any recollection or memory. Appellant was in the role of father to\\n      [Sam] and [Suzie] when the sexual abuse occurred against each.\\n      The sexual abuse occurred in the same house and same bathroom\\n      . . . . [Suzie] described an act of anal penetration that was the\\n      same act to which [Sam] testified.\\n\\n      In Pendleton v. Corn., 685 S.W.2d 549, 552 (Ky. 1985), this Court held\\n\\n\"[e]vidence of independent sexual acts between the accused and persons other\\n\\nthan the victim are admissible if such acts are similar to that charged and not\\n\\ntoo remote in time provided the acts are relevant to prove intent, motive or a\\n\\ncommon plan or pattern of activity.\" Appellant argues that Pendleton is\\n\\ndistinguishable from his case for several reasons. First, he argues that the\\n\\nfacts that Suzie and Sam are of different genders and ages, and that Suzie is\\n\\nnot his biological daughter, while Sam is his biological son, make the acts\\n\\ndissimilar. We disagree. The sexual actâ\\x80\\x94anal sodomyâ\\x80\\x94was the same in both\\n\\ninstances. The fact that Suzie happened to be female did not alter the type of\\n\\nsexual act Appellant subjected her to. Sam was likely around eight years old\\n\\nwhen his father and uncle sodomized him, while Suzie was between twelve and\\n\\nfourteen when Appellant sodomized her. We do not believe this approximate\\n\\nfour-year age difference is enough to say that the acts are not of a similar\\n\\nnature. Finally, Appellant was the only father figure Suzie had ever known.\\n\\nShe and Appellant had lived in the same home since she was eighteen months\\n\\nold. As the trial court found, Appellant was a father figure for both Suzie and\\n\\nSam when he sodomized them.\\n\\n      Next, Appellant argues that, under Pendleton, the acts were too remote in\\n\\ntime for Suzie\\'s allegations to be properly admitted at trial. We disagree. When\\n                                         11\\n\\nthey testified at trial, Suzie was sixteen years old and Sam was twelve. Suzie\\'s\\n\\nabuse occurred when she was between the ages of twelve and fourteen (or two\\n\\nto four years prior to the trial) and the last time Sam described being\\n\\nsodomized occurred when he was about eight years old (or about four years\\n\\nbefore trial). So, these events occurred at the most two years apart, but\\n\\npossibly even closer in time.\\n\\nTRUE\\tSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\t3) Standard Of Review\\n\\n      Under the Bell factors, the trial court had to first determine that the\\n\\nevidence was relevant to prove something apart from Appellant\\'s criminal\\n\\ndisposition before it could admit Suzie\\'s testimony. The trial court found that\\n\\nthe testimony was relevant to show Appellant\\'s pattern of conduct.\\n\\n      The next Bell factor required the trial court to determine if Suzie\\'s\\n\\ntestimony of Appellant\\'s other sexual acts was sufficiently probative and, if so,\\n\\nwhether the probative value was outweighed by undue prejudice. Appellant\\n\\npoints out our language in Driver v. Commonwealth, 361 S.W.3d 877, 885-86\\n\\n(Ky. 2012), that \"prior acts of violence or threats of violence against persons\\n\\nother than the victim in the case on trial have significantly less probative value\\n\\nthan similar prior acts and threats against the same victim.\" He goes on to\\n\\nnote that lain exception has been recognized when the threat against the third\\n\\nperson is so close in time to the charged offense as to be considered a part of\\n\\nthe same transaction.\" Id. at 886 citing Chatt v. Commonwealth, 268 Ky. 141,\\n\\n103 S.W.2d 952, 954-955 (Ky. 1937). However, we emphasize that these were\\n\\nnot threats of violence as contemplated by Driver and Chatt; nor were they\\n\\nunproven allegations of sexual abuse brought up for the first time at trial, as\\n\\n                                         12\\nwas the case in Bell. Rather, Suzie\\'s testimony was describing abuse for which\\n\\nAppellant had been previously charged and to which he had already pled guilty\\n\\n(thought this fact was not revealed to the jury). We cannot hold that the trial\\n\\ncourt abused its discretion in allowing the testimony to come in under these\\n\\nfactorsâ\\x80\\x94it was close enough in time and circumstances to be considered part\\n\\nof the same transaction and to show a course of conduct. Moreover, as this\\n\\nCourt held in Commonwealth v. English, 993 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Ky. 1999):\\n\\n      [t]he test of relevancy having been satisfied by proof of a modus\\n      operandi, the evidence of [Appellant\\'s] prior sexual misconduct was\\n      properly admitted unless its probative value was substantially\\n      outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice. KRE 403. This is the\\n      point at which the issue of temporal remoteness becomes a factor\\n      in determining admissibility. Robey v. Commonwealth, Ky., 943\\nS.W.2d 616, 618 (1997). However, it is not the sole determining\\n      factor. While temporal remoteness tends to lessen the probative\\n      value of the evidence of Appellee\\'s prior sexual misconduct, its\\n      probativeness is conversely heightened by the multiplicity of\\n      victims, the multiplicity of occurrences, and the fact that the abuse\\n      was perpetrated against members of several generations of the\\n      same family. Lear v. Commonwealth, Ky., 884 S.W.2d 657 (1994).\\n      The balancing of the probative value of such evidence against the\\n      danger of undue prejudice is a task properly reserved for the sound\\n      discretion of the trial judge. Rake v. Commonwealth, Ky., 450\\nS.W.2d 527, 528 (1970).\\n\\nSee also Jones v. Commonwealth, No. 2002-SC-1011-DG, 2005 WL 635051, at\\n\\n*2 (Ky. Mar. 17, 2005) (\"When the charged crime and the uncharged crime are\\n\\nso similar and so unique as to indicate a reasonable probability that the crimes\\n\\nwere committed by the same person, under the same circumstances, the\\n\\nevidence of the uncharged crime is admissible.\").\\n\\n      Suzie\\'s testimony tended to show that Appellant had a common scheme\\n\\nor pattern of conduct: sodomizing his children in the bathroom of their home.\\n\\n                                        13\\nOf course this testimony is prejudicial to his caseâ\\x80\\x94just as any adverse\\n\\nevidence is. However, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\\n\\nin finding that Suzie\\'s testimony was not only probative, but that it was also\\n\\nmore probative than prejudicial. Suzie\\'s testimony was properly admitted for\\n\\nthe limited purpose of showing Appellant\\'s pattern of conduct.\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\t2. Unpreserved Evidentiary Errors\\n\\n      Appellant alleges that, although unobjected to, the remainder of his\\n\\nallegations of error were, in fact, preserved, as the trial court \"was on notice\\n\\nthat such evidence should not be admitted.\" This argument is disingenuous,\\n\\nas Appellant admits that \"his trial counsel inexplicably did not object.\" In fact,\\n\\ntrial counsel failed to object even after the trial court sua sponte asked counsel\\n\\nto approach the bench and raised KRE 404(b) concerns. Even after the trial\\n\\ncourt pointed out that there had been no objection on those grounds,\\n\\nAppellant\\'s trial counsel still failed to make one. Appellant asks, in the\\n\\nalternative, that we review these allegations for palpable error pursuant to RCr\\n\\n10.26. \"Palpable error affects the substantial rights of the party and results in\\n\\nmanifest injustice. Furthermore, an appellant claiming palpable error must\\n\\nshow that the error was more likely than ordinary error to have affected the\\n\\njury.\" Boyd v. Commonwealth, 439 S.W.3d 126, 129-30 (Ky. 2014). \"In\\n\\ndetermining whether an error is palpable, \\'an appellate court must consider\\n\\nwhether on the whole case there is a substantial possibility that the result\\n\\nwould have been any different.\"\\' Commonwealth v. Pace, 82 S.W.3d 894, 895\\n\\n(Ky. 2002) (citing Commonwealth v. McIntosh, 646 S.W.2d 43. 45 (Ky. 1983)).\\n\\n\\n                                         14\\nWe will not examine whether any error occurred in these instances, but only, if\\n\\nthere was an error, if it rose to the level of palpable error.\\n\\nTRUE\\tTESTIMONY\\ta. Patty\\'s testimony\\n\\n      Appellant\\'s first unpreserved contention arose from the testimony of his\\n\\ndaughter, Patty, who was eight years old at the time of trial. When the\\n\\nCommonwealth asked Patty if she had been sexually abused, she responded in\\n\\nthe affirmative. Then, when the Commonwealth asked Patty who had abused\\n\\nher, she said, \"my dad.\" Appellant did not object, but now complains that he\\n\\nhad no notice under KRE 404(c) that this testimony would be provided and\\n\\nthat it failed to meet the admissibility requirements under the Bell test.\\n\\nThe Commonwealth points out that it did not follow up on Patty\\'s\\n\\nresponse that Appellant had sexually abused her. Rather, it immediately asked\\n\\nPatty if anyone else had sexually abused her and began asking her questions\\n\\nabout Matt. The Commonwealth did nothing to emphasize Patty\\'s statement\\n\\nabout Appellant. We hold that any error in the admission of Patty\\'s testimony\\n\\nwas not \"more likely than ordinary error to have affected the jury.\"    Boyd, 439\\n\\nS.W.3d at 129-30 (Ky. 2014). Furthermore, considering the other evidence\\n\\npresented against Appellant, there is no \"substantial possibility that the result\\n\\nwould have been any different\" in the absence of any such error.       Pace, 82\\n\\nS.W.3d at 895.\\n\\n\\nTRUE\\tTESTIMONY\\t b. Sam\\'s testimony of physical abuse\\n\\n\\n      During Sam\\'s testimony, he recounted an event during which Appellant\\n\\nslammed his head into the bathroom wall, leaving a hole visible in pictures he\\n\\n\\n                                          15\\nand Suzie were shown to identify the bathroom in which Appellant sodomized\\n\\nthem. When the Commonwealth asked Sam about this event, the trial court\\n\\nasked counsel to approach the bench and expressed concerns about KRE\\n\\n404(b). Appellant\\'s counsel\\'s only remark was that he did not \"have notice of\\n\\n404(c).\" Appellant never objected to the line of questioning. The trial judge\\n\\ninformed the Commonwealth that if these claims could be related to the\\n\\ncharges, that would be fine, but, \"just general evidence about these are bad\\n\\npeople despite the lack of objection, I am not going to allow that.\" (Emphasis\\n\\nadded.)The Commonwealth argues that this testimony should have come in to\\n\\navoid any unanimous verdict issues. There is no need for us to address that\\n\\ncontention, because, due to the lack of objectionâ\\x80\\x94even though the trial court\\n\\nindicated that it may be a concernâ\\x80\\x94we will review only for palpable error. Sam\\n\\ntestified in depth about what Appellant did to him sexually. There is no\\n\\nsubstantial possibility that a manifest injustice occurred such that the result -\\n\\nin the case would have been any different absent testimony of physical abuse.\\n\\nTherefore, we hold that there was no palpable error.\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tc. Drug and Alcohol Use\\n\\n      Again, Appellant raised no objection to any admission of testimony that\\n\\nhe drank, used drugs, or was unemployed. Much of the testimony regarding\\n\\nhis alcohol use was when the children were \"setting the scene\" for the events\\n\\nsurrounding their abuse. The testimony concerning his unemployment only\\n\\ncame up when a witness testified that he stayed home with the kids. Due to\\n\\n\\n                                        16\\nthe testimonial evidence the jury heard from Sam and Suzie concerning being\\n\\nsodomized by Appellant, there is no substantial possibility that a manifest\\n\\ninjustice occurred such that the result in the case would have been any\\n\\ndifferent absent testimony of physical abuse. Therefore, we hold that there was\\n\\nno palpable error.\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tC. Sentence\\n\\n      The jury recommended that Appellant be sentenced to life imprisonment\\n\\nfor sodomy, fifty years\\' imprisonment for incest, and twenty years\\'\\n\\nimprisonment for use of a minor in a sexual performance. The judgment is\\n\\nsilent as to whether the sentences are to run concurrently or consecutively.\\n\\nAppellant claims that the trial court erred in ordering that his life sentence be\\n\\nrun consecutively to a twenty year sentence he was already in the process of\\n\\nserving. He points out that this ruling was made orally, but that the\\n\\nsentencing order failed to reflect whether the sentences were to be run\\n\\nconcurrently or consecutively.\\n\\n      As the Commonwealth points out, the sentences must be served\\n\\nconcurrently pursuant to KRS 532.110, which provides:\\n\\n       (2) If the court does not specify the manner in which a sentence\\n      imposed by it is to run, the sentence shall run concurrently with\\n      any other sentence which the defendant must serve unless the\\n      sentence is required by subsection (3) of this section or KRS\\n      533.060 to run consecutively.\\n\\nWhile the trial court did orally rule from the bench that Appellant\\'s life\\n\\nsentence should be served consecutively to the twenty-year sentence he had\\n\\nalready begun serving (and even indicated he would like a ruling from this\\n\\n\\n                                         17\\nCourt on the issue), the written order did not reflect this. In fact, the order did\\n\\nnot refer to Appellant\\'s twenty-year sentence at all. \"[T]he rule in Kentucky is\\n\\nthat when there is an inconsistency between oral statements of the presiding\\n\\njudge and an order or judgment reduced to writing, the written order or\\n\\njudgment prevails.\"    Cardwell v. Commonwealth, 12 S.W.3d 672, 678 (Ky.\\n\\n2000), citing RCr 13.04; CR 54.01; Commonwealth v. Taber, Ky., 941 S.W.2d\\n463, 464 (1997); Commonwealth v. Hicks, Ky., 869 S.W.2d 35, 37-38 (1994).\\n\\n      Appellant\\'s sentence, as pronounced in the written sentencing order,\\n\\ncomports with the law. There is no relief to be granted upon this issue and we\\n\\nwill not address it further.\\n\\nTRUE\\tCONCLUSION\\t                                III. CONCLUSION\\n\\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Appellant\\'s convictions and\\n\\nsentence.Minton, C.J., Abramson, Barber, Cunningham, Keller, and Noble, JJ.,\\n\\nconcur. Venters, J., dissents by separate opinion.VENTERS, J., DISSENTS: I respectfully dissent because I believe that\\n\\nAppellant\\'s trial on three counts involving a single victim should not have been\\n\\njoined for trial with the multitude of charges against his brother, Matt,\\n\\ninvolving seventeen crimes against seven different\\' victims. The majority\\n\\nconcedes that much of the evidence presented against Matt would have been\\n\\ninadmissible in a trial against Appellant.\\n\\nThe fact that Appellant was being tried alongside his brother does not\\n\\nrender such evidence admissible against Appellant; in fact, the association of\\n\\n                                         18\\nAppellant at trial with his brother on the unrelated crimes enhanced the\\n\\nprejudicial effect of the improper evidence. I do not believe any trial judge\\n\\ncould fashion an admonition to the jury sufficient to remove that taint.\\n\\nIntroducing such prejudicial evidence and telling the jury not to consider it was\\n\\nlike throwing hot pepper into the stew and telling the jury not to taste it. I\\n\\nbelieve Appellant\\'s conviction should be reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT:\\n\\nJason Apollo Hart, Assistant Public Advocate\\n\\n\\nCOUNSEL FOR APPELLEE:\\n\\nJack Conway, Attorney General of Kentucky\\nJames Hays Lawson, Assistant Attorney General\\n\\nTRUE\\tBACKGROUND\\tI. BACKGROUND\\n\\nTRUE\\tSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\tA. Substantive Facts\\n\\n       On February 17, 2001, Kenneth Flowers (Flowers) was murdered by a man who has never\\n\\nbeen identified. The shooter asked Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s brother if he was Flowers, and when the brother said\\n\\nno, the shooter departed. Soon the shooter returned, asked Flowers â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s up?â\\x80\\x9d and fatally shot\\n\\nFlowers. R. 16 (06/16/03 Trial Tr., Dequan Flowers at 159â\\x80\\x9361). Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s mother, Emma Flowers,\\n\\nand her neighbor, Lucretia Adams (Adams), told an officer that they suspected Willie James Jones,\\n\\nwhom they knew by the nickname â\\x80\\x9cNookie.â\\x80\\x9dMcLister Trice was the link between Flowers and Jones. She had dated and had a child with\\n\\nJones, and dated Flowers from October 2000 to January 2001. After breaking up with Flowers three\\n\\nweeks before the murder, Trice filed several police reports about Flowers vandalizing her car and\\n\\nstalking her. She also obtained a personal protective order against him. Tensions escalated in early\\n\\nFebruary 2001, when Flowers followed Trice into a liquor store. Jones was with Trice, and an\\n\\nargument ensued. Flowers struck Triceâ\\x80\\x99s head, and in return Trice hit Flowers with a wine bottle.\\n\\nFlowers ran from the store and told his companion, Jeff Adams, that Flowers had punched Jones and\\n\\nthat Jones had a gun. Jeff Adams testified to these facts, though he had not witnessed the fight.\\n\\nTrice, however, insisted that Jones was not involved and did not have a gun.Around 10 a.m. on the morning of the shooting, Trice drove to the home of her stepmother,Patricia Wilson. Flowers, who lived across the street, approached Triceâ\\x80\\x99s car and punched her\\n\\nwindow. Adams testified that she overheard Trice tell Flowers â\\x80\\x9cB----, you going to die today. Nook\\n\\n-- my baby daddy Nook is setting it up now.â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03 Trial Tr., Adams at 113). Emma\\n\\nFlowersâ\\x80\\x99s testimony was substantially similar. Id. (E. Flowers at 132) (â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98B----, you going to die\\n\\ntoday. My baby daddy Nook is out making arrangements for you to be killed.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d). Trice denied\\n\\nmaking these statements, and Jones denied telling Trice that he planned to kill Flowers.\\n                                                 2\\n       Afterward, Trice called her stepmother, Patricia Wilson. Wilson later testified that Trice told\\n\\nher about the incident with Flowers and â\\x80\\x9cthat Nook was going to take care of it that day.â\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n\\n(Wilson at 103).Around noon, Jones stopped by Triceâ\\x80\\x99s workplace. Trice told Jones and other people about\\n\\nthe encounter with Flowers. Around 4 p.m., Jones called Trice to say that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been\\n\\ntaken care of.â\\x80\\x9d Id. (Trice at 40). Trice responded â\\x80\\x9c[d]onâ\\x80\\x99t go over there bothering him,â\\x80\\x9d but Jones\\n\\nsaid â\\x80\\x9cI paid the n-----.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 40, 45. Three hours later and after the shooting, Jones visited Trice\\n\\nat work again. Trice asked Jones whether he had â\\x80\\x9canything to do with it.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 44. Jones seemed\\n\\nto be drinking and his response was ambiguous: â\\x80\\x9c[w]hat you thought.â\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n\\nTRUE\\tPROCEDURE\\t\\tB. Procedure\\n\\n       Before Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s trial, the trial court excluded testimony from Emma Flowers and Adams about\\n\\nTriceâ\\x80\\x99s statement (â\\x80\\x9cyou going to die today; Nook is setting it up nowâ\\x80\\x9d) because it appeared to be\\n\\ndouble hearsay, lack foundation, and might fall outside of Michiganâ\\x80\\x99s then-existing state-of-mind\\n\\nexception to the hearsay prohibition. The trial court withheld judgment on whether the evidence\\n\\ncould be introduced to impeach Trice. The court also excluded Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s testimony that Trice had\\n\\ntold her that Jones would take care of Triceâ\\x80\\x99s problem with Flowers.\\n\\n       The evidentiary issue reemerged at trial. On direct examination, Trice could not recall the\\n\\ntime at which she spoke to Jones. The government referenced a statement that Trice had given to\\n\\npolice after the shooting when she had been arrested for her own alleged involvement. The\\n\\ngovernment offered the statement to Trice to refresh her recollection. Trice then testified that, at 4\\n                                                  3\\np.m., Jones had said â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been taken care ofâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c[h]e already paid someone.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at\\n\\n40. The government asked whether Trice had said anything to Flowers that morning, but the judge\\n\\nsent the jury away before Trice answered. The judge informed the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s counsel that it\\n\\nwould not permit questioning on an irrelevant point as a means of creating an innocuous\\n\\ninconsistency from which to introduce Emma Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s and Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s statements â\\x80\\x9cunder the guise\\n\\nof impeachment.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 47. The judge then cautioned the defense attorney to constrain her\\n\\nquestions to avoid â\\x80\\x9copen[ing] the door for the admission . . . of the heretofore barred . . . statements.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nId. at 56â\\x80\\x9357.On cross-examination, Trice claimed that she did not know what Jones was talking about\\n\\nwhen he mentioned paying someone to take care of an order. Defense counsel also asked a series\\n\\nof questions to undermine the credibility of Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statement to the police: she had been arrested,\\n\\nwas poorly treated, did not write the statement herself, and signed it while scared, threatened, and\\n\\nhungry. Based on this latter set of questions, the trial court ruled that defense counsel had opened\\n\\nthe door to the hearsay statements, permitting the government to rehabilitate Trice with her\\n\\nconsistent, pre-arrest statements. Wilson, Emma Flowers, and Adams testified to the statements\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat Nook was going to take care of it that day,â\\x80\\x9d id. (Wilson at 103), and â\\x80\\x9c[b]----, you going to die\\n\\ntoday. Nook -- my baby daddy Nook is setting it up now,â\\x80\\x9d id. (Adams at 113); see also id. (E.\\n\\nFlowers at 132). Defense counsel objected specifically to Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s testimony but the judge admitted\\n\\nit both as a prior consistent statement and for impeachment.

Standard of Review\\n\\n       â\\x80\\x9cIn a habeas corpus proceeding, this Court reviews a district courtâ\\x80\\x99s legal conclusions de\\n\\nnovo and its factual findings for clear error.â\\x80\\x9d Goff v.

Â§ 2254(d)(2).\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tB. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\\n\\n       Jones challenges the assistance of his trial counsel on two bases. First, he asserts that his\\n\\nattorney provided ineffective assistance by opening the door for Triceâ\\x80\\x99s prior statements to come into\\n\\nevidence by discrediting Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statement to the police, even though her statement to the police was\\n\\nnot actually admitted into evidence. Second, he complains that his attorney did not request that the\\n\\njudge instruct the jury to consider Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s, Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s, and Emma Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s testimony only for its\\n\\nimpeachment value. To succeed on his ineffective-assistance claim, Jones must show that the state\\n\\ncourts unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), which requires both deficient performance and prejudice to the defense. Attorney performance is deficient if\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccounselâ\\x80\\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonablenessâ\\x80\\x9d by making â\\x80\\x9cerrors so\\n\\nserious that counsel was not functioning as the â\\x80\\x98counselâ\\x80\\x99 guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nId. at 687â\\x80\\x9388. â\\x80\\x9cOur review of counselâ\\x80\\x99s performance is highly deferential and counsel is strongly\\n\\npresumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of\\n\\nreasonable professional judgment.â\\x80\\x9d Johnson v. Bell, 525 F.3d 466, 487 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal\\n\\nquotation marks omitted).\\n\\nTRUE\\tJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\\t1. Opening the Door For Prejudicial Hearsay\\n\\n       Opening the door to damaging testimony can constitute deficient performance. See, e.g.,\\n\\nWhite v. Thaler, 610 F.3d 890, 900 (5th Cir. 2010). Here, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals\\n\\nfound that opening the door was a necessary consequence of the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s much-needed attack on\\n\\nTriceâ\\x80\\x99s credibility. That consequence was damaging, but we consider it in context, alongside the\\n\\nbeneficial results of the strategy and in light of counselâ\\x80\\x99s slim options. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539\\nU.S. 510, 523 (2003) (using â\\x80\\x9ca context-dependent consideration of the challenged [attorney] conductâ\\x80\\x9d).On direct examination, Trice had testified to Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s statements that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been\\n\\ntaken care of,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c[h]e already paid someone,â\\x80\\x9d and he had done â\\x80\\x9c[w]hat you thought.â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03\\n\\nTrial Tr., Trice at 40, 44). Although Triceâ\\x80\\x99s police statement had not been admitted into evidence,\\n\\nthe jury was aware of her statement to police because the prosecution had referenced it when\\n\\nrefreshing Triceâ\\x80\\x99s recollection. Jones admits that direct examination implied that the police report\\n\\nwas consistent with Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statements. Doing nothing to counter these damaging claims and\\n\\nimplications on cross-examination would not have been a wise choice, despite what Jones argues\\n\\nnow. The Michigan Court of Appeals did not unreasonably determine that, â\\x80\\x9c[b]ecause of the nature\\n\\nof [Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statements on direct], defense counsel would have been remiss not to address the\\n\\nstatements on cross-examination and attempt to explain them.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578, at *3.\\n\\n       Debunking the police report removed any enhanced credibility that the police report had\\n\\nadded to Triceâ\\x80\\x99s testimony. Jones argues that his attorney performed deficiently because she acted\\n                                                 7\\non the false belief that the police report was in evidence. But his attorney explicitly confirmed her\\n\\nunderstanding that the statement was not in evidence. R. 17 at 79 (â\\x80\\x9cTHE COURT: â\\x80\\x98You know, her\\n\\nstatement is actually not in evidence, [defense counsel]. Her trial testimony is.â\\x80\\x99 [DEFENSE\\n\\nCOUNSEL]: â\\x80\\x98I understand.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d). Defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s cross-examination was directed at â\\x80\\x9cwhat the\\n\\nprosecutor said when he was asking [Trice] questions. He asked about her [police] statement, what\\n\\nshe said in her statement.â\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n\\nSome portions of the cross-examination strategy did not depend on the police report. For\\n\\nexample, the defense attorney extracted from Trice that she did not know what Jones was talking\\n\\nabout when he referenced the order that he had taken care of or when he said that he had paid\\n\\nsomeone. The judge had warned the defense attorney about the risk of opening the door to\\n\\npreviously excluded testimony. In hindsight, perhaps refraining from asking about the police report\\n\\nwould have been a better strategy. But given the deference with which we review attorney decisions,\\n\\nwe cannot say that the state courts were unreasonable in concluding that the choice was not\\n\\nconstitutionally deficient. The circumstances of the police reportâ\\x80\\x94Triceâ\\x80\\x99s own arrest as well as her\\n\\nmaltreatmentâ\\x80\\x94make her statements dubious. That line of questioning may have had more force than\\n\\ndid Triceâ\\x80\\x99s admission that she felt that Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s statements were ambiguous. Also, each of the\\n\\nhearsay statements relies on Triceâ\\x80\\x99s credibility as a declarant. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s trial counsel reasonably might\\n\\nhave decided that the benefit of casting doubt on Triceâ\\x80\\x99s testimony outweighed the harm of new\\n\\nwitnesses testifying to statements similar to what that the jury had already heard.\\n                                                  8\\n       The Michigan Court of Appeals held that â\\x80\\x9c[c]ounselâ\\x80\\x99s strategy was clearly to try to show that\\n\\nTrice did not know what defendant meant by the statements. Given counselâ\\x80\\x99s limited options, this\\n\\nstrategy was not unsound.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578, at *3. The attorneyâ\\x80\\x99s strategy was somewhat\\n\\nbroader in that it probed the circumstances of the police report, but the state court was not\\n\\nunreasonable in determining that the attorney exercised professional judgment and provided\\n\\nconstitutionally adequate assistance. Thus, Jones cannot demonstrate ineffective assistance of\\n\\ncounsel.\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\t2. Failing to Request A Limiting Instruction\\n\\n       Although Jones briefs the issue on appeal, his habeas petition does not allege that trial\\n\\ncounselâ\\x80\\x99s performance was deficient for failing to request a limiting instruction for the testimony of\\n\\nWilson, Emma Flowers, or Adams. While the claim bears some resemblance to his first ineffective-\\n\\nassistance claim, his petition did not fairly raise the issue of limiting instructions. We therefore may\\n\\nnot review the claim. See Seymour v. Walker, 224 F.3d 542, 561 (6th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532\\nU.S. 989 (2001).\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tC. Double Jeopardy\\n\\n       The Fifth Amendment ensures that no one may â\\x80\\x9cbe subject for the same offence to be twice\\n\\nput in jeopardy of life or limb.â\\x80\\x9d U.S. CONST . amend. V. That clause protects criminal defendants\\n\\nfrom prosecution following conviction or acquittal for the same offense, and also prohibits infliction\\n\\nof â\\x80\\x9cmultiple punishments for the same offense imposed in a single proceeding.â\\x80\\x9d Jones v. Thomas,\\n\\n491 U.S. 376, 381 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). â\\x80\\x9cWith respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court\\n\\nfrom prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.â\\x80\\x9d Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S.\\n359, 366 (1983). In fact, â\\x80\\x9cthe Court has never held or intimated that the constitutional bar against\\n\\ndouble jeopardy circumscribes the legislative prerogative to define crimes and prescribe punishment\\n\\nin the context of a single prosecution.â\\x80\\x9d White v. Howes, 586 F.3d 1025, 1032 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3370 (2010). â\\x80\\x9cEven if the crimes are the same under Blockburger [v. United\\n\\nStates, 284 U.S. 299 (1932)], if it is evident that a state legislature intended to authorize cumulative\\n\\npunishments, a courtâ\\x80\\x99s inquiry is at an end.â\\x80\\x9d Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493, 499 n.8 (1984); see also\\n\\nWhite, 586 F.3d at 1032 (denying habeas even though the panel â\\x80\\x9cagree[d] . . . that the two statutes\\n\\nat issue . . . punish the same offense under Blockburgerâ\\x80\\x9d).We owe the Michigan courts deference even if, as seems to be the case, Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s appeal was the first time that they ruled on the issue. Because â\\x80\\x9cthe only question for the [Michigan] Court of\\n\\nAppeals was what the legislature had intended,â\\x80\\x9d any error in its reasoning â\\x80\\x9cis purely a matter of state\\n\\nlaw.â\\x80\\x9d McCloud v. Deppisch, 409 F.3d 869, 874 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1063 (2005); see\\n\\nalso Banner v. Davis, 886 F.2d 777, 782 (6th Cir. 1989) (holding that we may not â\\x80\\x9cindependently\\n\\nevaluate the scope of the Tennessee statutes here, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals and\\n\\n[Tennessee] Supreme Court having already held that the legislature intended cumulative\\n\\npunishmentsâ\\x80\\x9d).1 â\\x80\\x9c[T]he fact that the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s interpretation of state law happens to be central\\nJones points to language in Banner limiting its relevance when the state courts â\\x80\\x9cfailed to\\ngive a clear expression on the issue of cumulative punishment.â\\x80\\x9d Banner, 886 F.2d at 782. Banner\\nused that language to distinguish Pryor v. Rose, 724 F.2d 525 (6th Cir. 1984) (en banc), an opinion\\n                                                  10\\nto the double jeopardy analysis does not permit us to review the [Michigan] Court of Appealsâ\\x80\\x99\\n\\nconstruction of [its own] law.â\\x80\\x9d McCloud, 409 F.3d at 875. It does not matter, as Jones argues, that\\n\\nthe state appellate decision was not precedential or that only a stateâ\\x80\\x99s supreme court can issue a\\n\\nbinding interpretation of state law. The state courtâ\\x80\\x99s decision of state law is not cognizable on\\n\\nhabeas review.\\n\\n       Jones cites Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 (1977), as an example of the Supreme Court reviewing the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s reasoning on a double jeopardy claim. In that case, the Court said that\\n\\nit â\\x80\\x9cagree[d] with the Ohio Court of Appeals that joyriding and auto theft, as defined by the [state]\\n\\ncourt, constitute the same statutory offense within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.â\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n\\nat 168. Put differently, the Court agreed that, given the lack of legislative authorization for multiple\\n\\npunishments, the convictions in Brown violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.A multiple-\\n\\npunishments challenge takes root only if the legislature did not authorize multiple punishments.\\n\\nWhen it has, there is no federal issue with which a federal court can agree or disagree. See Banner,\\n\\n886 F.2d at 782 (rejecting the reading of Brown advocated by Jones).In this case, we must accept the Michigan Court of Appealsâ\\x80\\x99 construction of the Michigan statutes: the murder statute â\\x80\\x9cprotect[s] human life and prohibit[s] wrongful slayingsâ\\x80\\x9d; the conspiracy\\nstatute â\\x80\\x9cprotect[s] society from the increased danger presented by group activityâ\\x80\\x9d; and the solicitation\\nthat did not make clear howâ\\x80\\x94or whetherâ\\x80\\x94the state court had decided the double-jeopardy question.\\nBanner, 886 F.2d at 782 & n.2. The Banner panel resolved the confusion by holding that we must\\ndefer to state-court holdings when the state â\\x80\\x9ccourts have carefully considered and analyzed the scope\\nof the [state] statutes.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 782. The Michigan Court of Appeals did so in this case, and we are\\nbound by Banner.\\n\\n                                                  11\\n\\n\\nstatute â\\x80\\x9cpr[o]scribe[s] the inducement of another to commit an offense.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578,\\n\\nat *5. A federal court reviewing a habeas petition may not, as Jones requests, reexamine the role of\\n\\nMichiganâ\\x80\\x99s rule of lenity, the level of generality at which to examine the purpose of each statute, or\\n\\nwhether Michiganâ\\x80\\x99s legislature intended to punish a single act of procurement under three statutes.\\n\\nGiven the distinct purposes of the statutes of conviction, there is no colorable argument that the\\n\\nDouble Jeopardy Clause protects Jones from being convicted under all three statutes.\\n\\nTRUE\\tDK\\tD. Sufficiency of the Evidence\\n\\n       Under AEDPA, challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict a petitioner\\n\\nmust survive â\\x80\\x9ctwo layers of deference to groups who might view facts differently than we would.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nBrown v. Konteh, 567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1081 (2010).\\n\\nId. (citations omitted). Jones challenges each of his three convictions, but he disputes the sufficiency\\n\\nof the evidence only as to (1) his intent and (2) his performance of acts that assisted in or his\\n\\nencouragement of the murder. Sufficient evidence supports both elements.\\n\\n                                                  12\\n\\nTRUE\\tACT\\tC. Precedent Under Federal Communications Acts.\\n\\n        One element of second-degree murder is the â\\x80\\x9cintent to kill, . . . inflict great bodily harm, or\\n\\n. . . create a very high risk of death with the knowledge that the act probably will cause death or great\\n\\nbodily harm.â\\x80\\x9d People v. Bailey, 549 N.W.2d 325, 331 (Mich. 1996). Under an aiding-and-abetting\\n\\ntheory of liability, the intent component is satisfied by, among other options, proof that â\\x80\\x9cthe\\n\\ndefendant intended the commission of the crime.â\\x80\\x9d People v. Robinson, 715 N.W.2d 44, 47â\\x80\\x9348\\n\\n(Mich. 2006) (internal quotation and alteration marks removed). â\\x80\\x9c[I]nten[t] that a murder would in\\n\\nfact be committedâ\\x80\\x9d is also an element of solicitation to commit murder. People v. Crawford, 591\\nN.W.2d 669, 673 (Mich. Ct. App. 1998). Similarly, conspiracy requires specific intent â\\x80\\x9cto combine\\n\\nwith othersâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cto accomplish the illegal objective.â\\x80\\x9d People v. Carter, 330 N.W.2d 314, 319\\n\\n(Mich. 1982), overruled in part on other grounds, People v. Robideau, 55 N.W.2d 592 (Mich. 1984).\\n\\nIn this case, a jury could reasonably find that Jones intended to have the victim killed and intended\\n\\nto make an agreement to kill the victim. Adams and Emma Flowers both testified that, based on the\\n\\nstatement that they overheard Trice make, Jones was arranging to have the victim killed. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s\\n\\nstatements to Triceâ\\x80\\x94that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been taken care of,â\\x80\\x9d that he had â\\x80\\x9cpaid the n-----,â\\x80\\x9d and,\\n\\nwhen asked â\\x80\\x9cwhether he had anything to do withâ\\x80\\x9d the victimâ\\x80\\x99s death, he responded â\\x80\\x9c[w]hat you\\n\\nthought,â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03 Trial Tr., Trice at 40, 42â\\x80\\x9345)â\\x80\\x94could be interpreted as evidence of intent.\\n\\nThe liquor-store conflict and Triceâ\\x80\\x99s difficulties with the victim also supply limited circumstantial\\n\\nsupport. Resolving factual disputes in favor of the prosecution, we cannot conclude that it was\\n\\nunreasonable for the Michigan Court of Appeals to determine that a rational trier of fact could find\\n\\nthat Jones had intended to kill Flowers.\\n\\nTRUE\\tACT\\tB. The Pole Attachment Act.\\n\\n       For similar reasons, the Michigan Court of Appeals was not unreasonable in finding that\\n\\nJones performed acts or gave encouragement to the shooter, as is required under an aiding-and-\\n\\nabetting theory, Robinson, 715 N.W.2d at 47â\\x80\\x9348, and that Jones made an agreement to commit\\n\\nmurder, which is required for a conspiracy conviction, Carter, 330 N.W.2d at 319.

       " '       In the interim, the United States Attorney for the District of Kansas, Barry R.\\nGrissom, sent a letter to the district attorney stating that Grissom was familiar with the\\nfacts surrounding Delacruz\\' case and that while the letter did not act as a \"formal grant of\\nimmunity,\" no federal prosecution against Delacruz was warranted or would be\\nforthcoming for his involvement in the murder of Haines.

The State\\ncomplained that Delacruz' refusal to testify made him unavailable for cross-examination,\\nrendered his video recorded statements inadmissible, and precluded the State from\\nexplaining to the jury why Delacruz was not called as a witness. The State asked for\\nconsecutive sentences of 36 months for each act of contempt, for a controlling sentence\\nof 108 months in prison, to be served consecutively to Delacruz' 83-month prison\\nsentence for aggravated robbery.\",\n",
       " '\\n       But when Delacruz appeared before Judge McCarville on May 23, 2011, the judge\\nrecited a different accusation of contempt to Delacruz.

Delacruz pled not guilty\\nand the matter was set for trial.',\n",
       " '\\n       On the morning scheduled for trial, Judge McCarville denied Delacruz\\' motion to\\ndismiss based upon the claim that Judge Chambers\\' order to testify had violated Delacruz\\'\\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Thereafter, Delacruz waived his right\\nto a jury trial and the case was submitted to Judge McCarville on stipulated facts.

Delacruz asked for a six-month sentence.\",\n",
       " \"\\n       Before pronouncing sentence, Judge McCarville endeavored to provide the\\nreasoning behind his decision, albeit the court might have overlooked that it was the\\nState, not the defendant, that had sought to compel Delacruz' testimony. The court\\nexplained:\",\n",

It doesn\\'t matter whether Mr. Delacruz received an\\n83-month sentence or a life sentence, you know, because we\\'re not talking about his\\nsentence for the crime that he was convicted of.

I believe that I\\nhave a duty to, under Canon One and Canon Two under the [Code] of Judicial Conduct to\\nmaintain the authority and dignity of the Court and it\\'s not whether the attorney general\\ncame here. The attorney general would be assisting the Court by presenting evidence and\\nmaking arguments to assist the Court in figuring out the Court\\'s duty but the duty to\\npunish for contempt of court is not an executive branch function. It\\'s a duty that the Court\\nhas as a part of the essence of what a court is. We are [a] separate and co-equal branch of\\ngovernment and our purpose is to make sure that all parties have a tribunal in which they\\nhave access to compulsory process that\\'s effective.

The privilege afforded not only applies to a witness\\' answers\\nthat would directly support a criminal conviction but also embraces those answers which\\nwould furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a\\ncrime.

One manner in which the State can\\nremove the fear of incrimination and compel testimony is to grant the witness immunity\\nin return for the witness' testimony. But not all grants of immunity will satisfy the\\nconstraints of the right against self-incrimination. As our Court of Appeals noted over\\ntwo decades ago:\",\n",
       " '\\n               \"\\'There are three recognized types of immunity: (1) \"transactional,\" (2) \"use and\\n       derivative use,\" and, (3) \"use.\" \"Transactional\" immunity protects the witness from\\n       prosecution for offenses to which the compelled testimony relates. This type of immunity\\n       is broader than the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and need not always\\n       be granted, although it does, of course, constitute adequate immunity. \"Use and\\n       derivative use\" immunity protects the witness from the use of compelled testimony and\\n       evidence derived therefrom. It is coextensive with the constitutional privilege against\\n       self-incrimination and is therefore a sufficient grant of immunity to compel self-\\n       incriminatory testimony. On the other hand, mere \"use\" immunity, which only prevents\\n       the prosecution from using the compelled testimony in any criminal proceeding, is not\\n       constitutionally adequate since it does not prevent prosecuting authorities from making\\n       derivative use of the fruits of a witness\\' compelled testimony by obtaining investigatory\\n       leads from it.\\'\" Cabral v.

       " '\\nDurrant was consistent with the landmark case of Kastigar, which, as noted above, held\\nthat if the government wants to compel testimony from a witness claiming the Fifth\\nAmendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, it must grant the witness at\\nleast use and derivative use immunity, otherwise a citation in contempt must be reversed.\\nHere, the State expressly granted Delacruz mere use immunity. To reiterate, the\\nwritten document provided to Delacruz was entitled, \"GRANT OF USE IMMUNITY,\"\\nand stated in the body that Delacruz was being granted \"immunity from the use of any\\ntestimony given in the above-captioned matter on February 28, 2011 through March 9,\\n2011.\" The document went on to explain that the use immunity being granted meant that\\nDelacruz\\' testimony would not be used against him in any potential future case. The\\ndocument did not mention the use of any evidence that might be derived from the\\ncompelled testimony. As Kastigar explained, the derivative use component of a\\ncoextensive grant of immunity is important because it \"[bars] the use of any evidence\\nobtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.\"\\n406 U.S. at 460. The State\\'s grant of immunity to Delacruz plainly did not include this\\nimportant component.',\n",
       " '\\n       Curiously, the grant of immunity document refers to the statute dealing with\\nimmunities, K.S.A. 22-3415, which specifically refers to use and derivative use immunity\\nunder subsection (b)(2). But the immunity document does not purport to incorporate that\\nstatutory definition by reference; rather, it recites that the immunity is being granted\\n\"pursuant to the authority vested in me as District Attorney, by K.S.A. 22-3415(a) [and]\\n                                                   16\\n(c).\" Those subsections, (a) and (c), have nothing to do with the type of immunity being\\ngranted. In other words, no reasonable inference on the type of immunity being granted\\ncan be discerned from the statutory reference.',\n",
       " \"\\n       To summarize, the State granted Delacruz use immunity; the use immunity\\ngranted was not coextensive with Delacruz' constitutional right against self-incrimination;\\ntherefore, Judge Chambers' order compelling Delacruz' testimony at the Waller trial\\nviolated Delacruz' constitutional right against self-incrimination and was unlawful.\\nConsequently, Judge McCarville's ensuing order, finding Delacruz in direct contempt of\\ncourt for refusing to testify and sentencing him to a consecutive 108-month prison term,\\nwas likewise unlawful.\",\n",

A jury convicted Delacruz of aggravated robbery but acquitted him of felony murder; the court sentenced Delacruz to an 83-month prison sentence. The conviction and sentence were upheld on appeal.

The trial judge, Honorable Timothy J. Chambers, took the matter under advisement.',\n",
       " '       In the interim, the United States Attorney for the District of Kansas, Barry R. Grissom, sent a letter to the district attorney stating that Grissom was familiar with the facts surrounding Delacruz\\' case and that while the letter did not act as a \"formal grant of immunity,\" no federal prosecution against Delacruz was warranted or would be forthcoming for his involvement in the murder of Haines. Grissom opined that the federal prosecution of Delacruz would violate the Department of Justice\\'s Petite policy. See Petite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529, 530, 80 S. Ct. 450, 4 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1960) (a federal trial following a state prosecution for the same conduct generally barred).',\n",
       " '        Judge Chambers then issued an order stating: \"K.S.A. 22-3415 confers upon the District Attorney the authority to grant use and derivative immunity. Written immunity has been granted by the District Attorney to Jose Delacruz. Therefore, Jose Delacruz will be compelled to testify in the trial of the above captioned matter.\" (Emphasis added.) The district court apparently did not address the fact that the written document purported to grant only use immunity. See Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 453-54, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212, reh. denied 408 U.S. 931 (1972) (mere use immunity insufficient protection under Fifth Amendment; use and derivative use immunity coextensive with constitutional privilege against self-incrimination).',\n",
       " \"        Delacruz appeared before Judge Chambers three times during Waller's trial and, upon advice of counsel, refused the judge's order to testify. Judge Chambers set a jury trial on the question of whether Delacruz was in direct criminal contempt of court for                                               4 refusing to testify at Waller's trial. Meanwhile, Waller was convicted of first-degree felony murder and aggravated kidnapping without Delacruz' testimony. See State v. Waller, 299 Kan. 707, 328 P.3d 1111 (2014) (affirming convictions and sentences). Delacruz' contempt case was reassigned to the Honorable Joseph L. McCarville III.\",\n",

The State complained that Delacruz' refusal to testify made him unavailable for cross-examination, rendered his video recorded statements inadmissible, and precluded the State from explaining to the jury why Delacruz was not called as a witness. The State asked for consecutive sentences of 36 months for each act of contempt, for a controlling sentence of 108 months in prison, to be served consecutively to Delacruz' 83-month prison sentence for aggravated robbery.\",\n",

Delacruz pled not guilty and the matter was set for trial.',\n",

Thereafter, Delacruz waived his right to a jury trial and the case was submitted to Judge McCarville on stipulated facts. After considering arguments, Judge McCarville stated,                                              5        \"There is really no doubt that Mr. Delacruz didn\\'t comply with a direct order from        District Judge Timothy J. Chambers, Division II, to testify in the Anthony Waller case        and based upon my previous rulings there is no reasonable basis for him to have claimed        the right not to testify under the Fifth Amendment so his refusal to testify was unlawful,        was willful, was intentional and felonious and occurred here in Reno County in this court.        The Court finds the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of felony criminal        contempt of court as alleged in the accusation.\"',\n",

Delacruz asked for a six-month sentence.\",\n",

Defendants charged with murder or other heinous crimes have the right to expect that if they have a witness that\\'s going to help present their defense that the Court will have the power to bring that person in and make them testify in order to help them prove their innocence and what Mr. Delacruz has done is to say well, maybe not so fast. It doesn\\'t apply when I decide that I\\'m not going to be the witness. \"What I need to know is okay, what is a sufficient sentence to cause a person in Mr. Delacruz\\'s position to decide that he\\'d rather testify and take his chances with whatever repercussions there might be that his attorneys tell him about. What is enough years or months to get him to say I\\'m going to take the stand, I\\'m going to testify because I do not want to degrade the authority of the Court. It\\'s certainly not six months. It certainly has to be a number of years. It doesn\\'t matter whether Mr. Delacruz received an 83-month sentence or a life sentence, you know, because we\\'re not talking about his sentence for the crime that he was convicted of. We\\'re talking about what he did in this contempt.         \"What does this do to the dignity and the authority of the Court?

The attorney general would be assisting the Court by presenting evidence and making arguments to assist the Court in figuring out the Court\\'s duty but the duty to punish for contempt of court is not an executive branch function.

One might presume the Legislature intended K.S.A. 20-1203\\'s written judgment of record requirement to serve the purpose normally served by a written accusation of contempt. And, in this case there were written accusations of contempt from both the prosecutor and the presiding judge, and Delacruz was afforded the opportunity for a trial on those accusations with counsel to represent his interests. Perhaps more importantly, this court has recently revisited the notion of subject matter jurisdiction in the context of using that label for due process violations or procedural infirmities.

App. 2d 522, 263 P.3d 852 [2011], for the proposition that the failure to exhaust administrative remedies does not deprive district court of subject matter jurisdiction).But unfortunately, because Delacruz did not challenge the district court\\'s jurisdiction or argue how the process utilized by the district court failed to comply with the mandates of K.S.A. 20-1203, the parties did not flesh out how the area of the law involved in this case fits within this court\\'s changing concepts of subject matter jurisdiction. Moreover, the answer on the merits is especially clear in this case. See Alvarado v. Holder, 743 F.3d 271, 276 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding that a court may \"put aside ambiguous jurisdictional questions\" under a statute \"when precedent clearly dictates the result on the merits\"); Sherrod v.

But \"the power to compel testimony is not absolute,\" and the most important exception to that power is the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 444, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972). Specifically, the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States declares that \"[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\" See also Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights Â§ 10 (\"No person shall be a witness against himself . . . .\"); K.S.A. 60-425                                                      14 (granting every natural person a privilege to refuse to disclose \"any matter that will incriminate such person\"). The privilege afforded not only applies to a witness\\' answers that would directly support a criminal conviction but also embraces those answers which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a crime. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S. Ct. 814, 95 L. Ed. 1118 (1951).',\n",
       " \"        On the other hand, a witness who has no reasonable cause to fear incrimination cannot invoke the right. Hoffman, 341 U.S. at 486. One manner in which the State can remove the fear of incrimination and compel testimony is to grant the witness immunity in return for the witness' testimony. But not all grants of immunity will satisfy the constraints of the right against self-incrimination. As our Court of Appeals noted over two decades ago:\",\n",
       " '                \"\\'There are three recognized types of immunity: (1) \"transactional,\" (2) \"use and        derivative use,\" and, (3) \"use.\" \"Transactional\" immunity protects the witness from        prosecution for offenses to which the compelled testimony relates. This type of immunity        is broader than the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and need not always        be granted, although it does, of course, constitute adequate immunity. \"Use and        derivative use\" immunity protects the witness from the use of compelled testimony and        evidence derived therefrom. It is coextensive with the constitutional privilege against        self-incrimination and is therefore a sufficient grant of immunity to compel self-        incriminatory testimony. On the other hand, mere \"use\" immunity, which only prevents        the prosecution from using the compelled testimony in any criminal proceeding, is not        constitutionally adequate since it does not prevent prosecuting authorities from making        derivative use of the fruits of a witness\\' compelled testimony by obtaining investigatory        leads from it.\\'\" Cabral v.

       " ' Durrant was consistent with the landmark case of Kastigar, which, as noted above, held that if the government wants to compel testimony from a witness claiming the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, it must grant the witness at least use and derivative use immunity, otherwise a citation in contempt must be reversed. Here, the State expressly granted Delacruz mere use immunity. To reiterate, the written document provided to Delacruz was entitled, \"GRANT OF USE IMMUNITY,\" and stated in the body that Delacruz was being granted \"immunity from the use of any testimony given in the above-captioned matter on February 28, 2011 through March 9, 2011.\" The document went on to explain that the use immunity being granted meant that Delacruz\\' testimony would not be used against him in any potential future case. The document did not mention the use of any evidence that might be derived from the compelled testimony. As Kastigar explained, the derivative use component of a coextensive grant of immunity is important because it \"[bars] the use of any evidence obtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.\" 406 U.S. at 460. The State\\'s grant of immunity to Delacruz plainly did not include this important component.',\n",
       " '        Curiously, the grant of immunity document refers to the statute dealing with immunities, K.S.A. 22-3415, which specifically refers to use and derivative use immunity under subsection (b)(2). But the immunity document does not purport to incorporate that statutory definition by reference; rather, it recites that the immunity is being granted \"pursuant to the authority vested in me as District Attorney, by K.S.A. 22-3415(a) [and]                                                    16 (c).\" Those subsections, (a) and (c), have nothing to do with the type of immunity being granted. In other words, no reasonable inference on the type of immunity being granted can be discerned from the statutory reference.',\n",
       " \"        To summarize, the State granted Delacruz use immunity; the use immunity granted was not coextensive with Delacruz' constitutional right against self-incrimination; therefore, Judge Chambers' order compelling Delacruz' testimony at the Waller trial violated Delacruz' constitutional right against self-incrimination and was unlawful. Consequently, Judge McCarville's ensuing order, finding Delacruz in direct contempt of court for refusing to testify and sentencing him to a consecutive 108-month prison term, was likewise unlawful.\",\n",
       " '        Accordingly, we reverse Judge McCarville\\'s order of contempt and vacate the 108- month sentence.

William Tony Wright, No. M2001-01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, June 19, 2002), the State contended that any argument or testimony suggesting the Appellant had no notice of the MVHO order was misleading because the Appellant had been convicted of violating the MVHO order on three prior occasions; therefore, such argument or testimony was inadmissible.',\n",
       " '        On September 30, 2015, immediately prior to trial, the trial court granted the Stateâ\\x80\\x99s motion. Defense counsel informed the trial court that he did not plan to collaterally attack the MVHO order. Instead, the defense strategy was to show that the State did not introduce proof the Appellant had notice of the MVHO order and that, accordingly, the State could not prove the Appellant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly violated the MVHO order. The State then suggested that the easiest way to establish the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s awareness of the MVHO order was to introduce proof of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s prior convictions of violating the order. Defense counsel responded that the State could prove the Appellant had notice of the order without informing the jury that the Appellant had prior convictions of the same crime, which were â\\x80\\x9cmore prejudicial than probative.â\\x80\\x9d The trial court warned that if the Appellant proceeded with the argument he did not have notice of the MVHO order, it would allow the State to rebut the claim by introducing â\\x80\\x9cdocuments regarding service of process and awareness of court dates.â\\x80\\x9d The State again noted the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s three prior convictions of violating the MVHO order and argued that because of those convictions, the Appellant was prohibited from asserting he had no notice of the order according to case law. The trial court agreed that the State could not â\\x80\\x9ctry the case with its hands behind its back like that,â\\x80\\x9d and reiterated its warning that if defense counsel raised the issue of notice, it would allow the State to rebut the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s claims.

Officer Kon saw the headlights of the Monte Carlo two or three hundred yards in front of his car â\\x80\\x9ccoming towardâ\\x80\\x9d him.

Officer Kon requested the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s name and date of birth, then he conveyed the information he obtained to the police dispatcher. After receiving a response from the dispatcher, Officer Kon arrested the Appellant for driving on a revoked license, violating a MVHO order, failing to provide proof of financial responsibility, and improper passing.

The order, which was dated January 20, 2005, prohibited the Appellant from driving for three years and ordered that he surrender his license to the court. On the second page of the order was a signed certificate of service reflecting that a â\\x80\\x9ctrue and exact copyâ\\x80\\x9d of the order had been â\\x80\\x9cmailed or hand-deliveredâ\\x80\\x9d to the Appellant â\\x80\\x9cand/orâ\\x80\\x9d his attorney.

Itâ\\x80\\x99s the front of the file that â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s the front of what would be a criminal case file.â\\x80\\x9d He explained that â\\x80\\x9conly two specific clerksâ\\x80\\x9d in the office made notations on the front of the file jacket. The grand jury clerk wrote the case number, the division assignment, and the reason for the case. The â\\x80\\x9cjudgeâ\\x80\\x99s in-court clerkâ\\x80\\x9d wrote the date of the docket and â\\x80\\x9cnotations similar to what would be on a minute entry.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer examined the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s file jacket and noticed that the first date listed was January 19, 2005. Kiefer said, â\\x80\\x9cThe notation for that day states that the [Appellant], Mr. William Hanson, was served and that the case was reset.â\\x80\\x9d The next date listed was January 20, 2005, which was the same date the MVHO order was entered.',\n",

Through her employment, she had access to driving histories. In preparation for trial, she accessed the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving history, which included a January 20, 2005 order declaring the Appellant to be a MVHO. The order resulted in the revocation of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s license. Graves stated that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges were never restored and that the order was in effect on the day of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s arrest. On cross-examination, Graves acknowledged that the branch of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security which was responsible for maintaining driving records was located in Nashville. She further acknowledged that she did not maintain the driving records. She also acknowledged that sometimes a driving record contained incorrect information but that it did not happen often. On redirect examination, Graves asserted that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record had â\\x80\\x9cbeen certified as true and accurate by Susan Lowe of the financial responsibility division.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",

He maintains that Wright did not stand for the proposition that a defendant could not collaterally attack an MVHO order. The Appellant did not cite any other cases in support of his contention. The Appellant contends that the trial courtâ\\x80\\x99s erroneous ruling limited his ability to argue that the State had failed to prove that the Appellant knew about the MVHO order and, accordingly, that the Appellant could not have violated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.',\n",

However, in Wright, the defendant pled guilty to violating an MVHO order. Wright, No. M2001-01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655, at *1.

Id. Simultaneously, the defendant filed a motion challenging the MVHO order under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02. Id. at *2. On appeal, this court determined that the defendantâ\\x80\\x99s issues turned upon whether he was entitled to relief under Rule 60.02 and, after consideration, held that â\\x80\\x9cthe trial court did not err in denying [the defendantâ\\x80\\x99s] motion for relief from the order declaring him to be a motor vehicle habitual offender.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at *4.',\n",

       " '       The record reflects that during closing argument, defense counsel acknowledged that the State had shown the jury the MVHO order but argued that it was required also to prove that the Appellant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly violated the order. Defense counsel told the jury that all three mental states â\\x80\\x9crequire [the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s] knowledge. That he knew this [order] existed.â\\x80\\x9d Defense counsel contended, however, the State presented no witnesses who testified that they saw the order being given to the Appellant or that he was in court the day the order was issued. The State objected to defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s argument as a collateral attack on the MVHO order after the proof was closed. Defense counsel responded that he was not arguing that the order was invalid. The trial court said that it was being â\\x80\\x9cliberalâ\\x80\\x9d with defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s argument but cautioned that if defense counsel went â\\x80\\x9ctoo far,â\\x80\\x9d it would let the State respond â\\x80\\x9cwithin the confines of the proof.â\\x80\\x9d The trial court agreed that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s prior convictions were not part of the proof; nevertheless, the court observed that defense counsel was attempting to â\\x80\\x9csand bagâ\\x80\\x9d the State by claiming the Appellant had no notice of the MVHO order after the proof was closed in order to render the State unable to rebut the claim.',\n",
       " '       Defense counsel maintained that the State could have introduced the minutes or transcript of the MVHO hearing or called the district attorney who prosecuted that case to prove the Appellant had knowledge of the MVHO order. However, the trial court responded that the State was not required to go to such lengths to prove the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s knowledge of the order and that it was â\\x80\\x9cdis[i]ngenuousâ\\x80\\x9d for defense counsel to argue that the Appellant did not have notice of the MVHO order. The trial court allowed defense                                            -6- counsel to argue â\\x80\\x9cabout what is on the orderâ\\x80\\x9d but refused to let him argue that the Appellant did not have notice of the order. The court cautioned that if defense counsel persisted in his argument, the court might â\\x80\\x9chave to craft a specific instruction,â\\x80\\x9d noting that the standard MVHO instruction did not explain that the State did not â\\x80\\x9chave to prove a negative. They have to prove there was an order and he drove.â\\x80\\x9d Initially, we note that the Appellant failed to cite any authority in support of his argument that the trial court erred by limiting his closing argument.

Our review of the record reveals that the trial court issued no such warning; instead, the trial court told the Appellant that it would allow the State to â\\x80\\x9cdo what they have got to do within the confines of the proofâ\\x80\\x9d and that the trial court would fashion a special jury instruction to inform the jury that the State did not have to prove the Appellant was in court on the day the MVHO order was issued.',\n",

Defense counsel also argued that Kiefer did not work at the court at the time the order was issued and therefore could not testify specifically about how the Appellant received the order, whether it was mailed or hand-delivered, and could not assert that the Appellant definitively had received the order. Although defense counsel was allowed to make this argument, it was inappropriate and an attempt to collaterally attack the underlying judgment.

He complains that the trial court required the Appellant to choose between allowing Graves to testify that his driving privileges had not been reinstated since the MVHO order or allowing the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s redacted driving history to be entered into evidence as a self-authenticating document. The State responds that the Appellant has waived the issue by failing to include the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record in the appellate record for our review. In the alternative, the State argues that the trial court did not err by limiting Gravesâ\\x80\\x99s testimony to whether the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges had been reinstated. We agree with the State. During a jury-out hearing, the State announced that it intended to call Glendora Graves as the keeper of the records of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security. She said that her department was responsible for issuing driverâ\\x80\\x99s licenses and keeping information regarding driverâ\\x80\\x99s histories.

The State responds that the proof was sufficient. On appeal, a jury conviction removes the presumption of the appellantâ\\x80\\x99s innocence and replaces it with one of guilt, so that the appellant carries the burden of demonstrating to this court why the evidence will not support the juryâ\\x80\\x99s findings. See State v. Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). The appellant must establish that no reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

The trial judge, Honorable Timothy J. Chambers, took the matter under advisement.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       In the interim, the United States Attorney for the District of Kansas, Barry R. Grissom, sent a letter to the district attorney stating that Grissom was familiar with the facts surrounding Delacruz\\' case and that while the letter did not act as a \"formal grant of immunity,\" no federal prosecution against Delacruz was warranted or would be forthcoming for his involvement in the murder of Haines. Grissom opined that the federal prosecution of Delacruz would violate the Department of Justice\\'s Petite policy. See Petite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529, 530, 80 S. Ct. 450, 4 L.

The district court apparently did not address the fact that the written document purported to grant only use immunity. See Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 453-54, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212, reh. denied 408 U.S. 931 (1972) (mere use immunity insufficient protection under Fifth Amendment; use and derivative use immunity coextensive with constitutional privilege against self-incrimination).',\n",

Meanwhile, Waller was convicted of first-degree felony murder and aggravated kidnapping without Delacruz' testimony. See State v. Waller, 299 Kan. 707, 328 P.3d 1111 (2014) (affirming convictions and sentences). Delacruz' contempt case was reassigned to the Honorable Joseph L. McCarville III.\",\n",
       " \"\\t\\t        The State then filed an accusation of contempt, charging Delacruz with three counts of criminal contempt based on the theory that each time he appeared before Judge Chambers and refused to testify constituted a separate contemptuous act. The State complained that Delacruz' refusal to testify made him unavailable for cross-examination, rendered his video recorded statements inadmissible, and precluded the State from explaining to the jury why Delacruz was not called as a witness. The State asked for consecutive sentences of 36 months for each act of contempt, for a controlling sentence of 108 months in prison, to be served consecutively to Delacruz' 83-month prison sentence for aggravated robbery.\",\n",
       " '\\t\\t        But when Delacruz appeared before Judge McCarville on May 23, 2011, the judge recited a different accusation of contempt to Delacruz. The court had sua sponte drafted a contempt accusation that alleged that Delacruz had committed one act of contempt for failing to comply with an order of the court \"to appear and testify under oath as a witness.\" Judge McCarville informed Delacruz that he would not impose a prison sentence greater than the State\\'s recommendation of 108 months. Delacruz pled not guilty and the matter was set for trial.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t        On the morning scheduled for trial, Judge McCarville denied Delacruz\\' motion to dismiss based upon the claim that Judge Chambers\\' order to testify had violated Delacruz\\' Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Thereafter, Delacruz waived his right to a jury trial and the case was submitted to Judge McCarville on stipulated facts. After considering arguments, Judge McCarville stated,                                              5        \"There is really no doubt that Mr. Delacruz didn\\'t comply with a direct order from        District Judge Timothy J. Chambers, Division II, to testify in the Anthony Waller case        and based upon my previous rulings there is no reasonable basis for him to have claimed        the right not to testify under the Fifth Amendment so his refusal to testify was unlawful,        was willful, was intentional and felonious and occurred here in Reno County in this court.        The Court finds the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of felony criminal        contempt of court as alleged in the accusation.\"',\n",

Delacruz asked for a six-month sentence.\",\n",
       " \"\\t\\t        Before pronouncing sentence, Judge McCarville endeavored to provide the reasoning behind his decision, albeit the court might have overlooked that it was the State, not the defendant, that had sought to compel Delacruz' testimony. The court explained:\",\n",

It certainly has to be a number of years. It doesn\\'t matter whether Mr. Delacruz received an 83-month sentence or a life sentence, you know, because we\\'re not talking about his sentence for the crime that he was convicted of.

When the prospective juror argued on appeal that the contempt order was void, the State countered with the argument that \"the purpose of the requirement of K.S.A. 20-1203 for a more detailed journal entry is to ensure a proper record for appellate review and that the hearing transcript\\'s recording of [the prospective juror\\'s] statement in her defense eliminates the need for such a journal entry in this case.\" 28 Kan.

One might presume the Legislature intended K.S.A. 20-1203\\'s written judgment of record requirement to serve the purpose normally served by a written accusation of contempt. And, in this case there were written accusations of contempt from both the prosecutor and the presiding judge, and Delacruz was afforded the opportunity for a trial on those accusations with counsel to represent his interests. Perhaps more importantly, this court has recently revisited the notion of subject matter jurisdiction in the context of using that label for due process violations or procedural infirmities.

Dunn, 304 Kan. 773, 811, 375 P.3d 332 (2016) (overruling long-standing precedent by holding that defective charging documents do not deprive state courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate criminal cases); State v.

App. 2d 522, 263 P.3d 852 [2011], for the proposition that the failure to exhaust administrative remedies does not deprive district court of subject matter jurisdiction).But unfortunately, because Delacruz did not challenge the district court\\'s jurisdiction or argue how the process utilized by the district court failed to comply with the mandates of K.S.A. 20-1203, the parties did not flesh out how the area of the law involved in this case fits within this court\\'s changing concepts of subject matter jurisdiction. Moreover, the answer on the merits is especially clear in this case. See Alvarado v. Holder, 743 F.3d 271, 276 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding that a court may \"put aside ambiguous jurisdictional questions\" under a statute \"when precedent clearly dictates the result on the merits\"); Sherrod v.

Boulder County Soc. Serv., 569 F.3d 1244, 1262-63 (10th Cir. 2009) (declining to consider a jurisdictional question where the party claiming jurisdiction would clearly lose on the merits); accord In re Todd, No. 110,958, 2014 WL 7152357, at *3 (Kan.

But \"the power to compel testimony is not absolute,\" and the most important exception to that power is the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 444, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972). Specifically, the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States declares that \"[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\" See also Kansas Constitution Bill of Rights Â§ 10 (\"No person shall be a witness against himself . . . .\"); K.S.A. 60-425                                                      14 (granting every natural person a privilege to refuse to disclose \"any matter that will incriminate such person\"). The privilege afforded not only applies to a witness\\' answers that would directly support a criminal conviction but also embraces those answers which would furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a crime. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S. Ct. 814, 95 L. Ed. 1118 (1951).',\n",
       " \"\\t\\t        On the other hand, a witness who has no reasonable cause to fear incrimination cannot invoke the right. Hoffman, 341 U.S. at 486. One manner in which the State can remove the fear of incrimination and compel testimony is to grant the witness immunity in return for the witness' testimony. But not all grants of immunity will satisfy the constraints of the right against self-incrimination. As our Court of Appeals noted over two decades ago:\",\n",
       " '\\t\\t                \"\\'There are three recognized types of immunity: (1) \"transactional,\" (2) \"use and        derivative use,\" and, (3) \"use.\" \"Transactional\" immunity protects the witness from        prosecution for offenses to which the compelled testimony relates. This type of immunity        is broader than the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and need not always        be granted, although it does, of course, constitute adequate immunity. \"Use and        derivative use\" immunity protects the witness from the use of compelled testimony and        evidence derived therefrom. It is coextensive with the constitutional privilege against        self-incrimination and is therefore a sufficient grant of immunity to compel self-        incriminatory testimony. On the other hand, mere \"use\" immunity, which only prevents        the prosecution from using the compelled testimony in any criminal proceeding, is not        constitutionally adequate since it does not prevent prosecuting authorities from making        derivative use of the fruits of a witness\\' compelled testimony by obtaining investigatory        leads from it.\\'\" Cabral v.

       " '\\t\\t Durrant was consistent with the landmark case of Kastigar, which, as noted above, held that if the government wants to compel testimony from a witness claiming the Fifth Amendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, it must grant the witness at least use and derivative use immunity, otherwise a citation in contempt must be reversed. Here, the State expressly granted Delacruz mere use immunity. To reiterate, the written document provided to Delacruz was entitled, \"GRANT OF USE IMMUNITY,\" and stated in the body that Delacruz was being granted \"immunity from the use of any testimony given in the above-captioned matter on February 28, 2011 through March 9, 2011.\" The document went on to explain that the use immunity being granted meant that Delacruz\\' testimony would not be used against him in any potential future case. The document did not mention the use of any evidence that might be derived from the compelled testimony. As Kastigar explained, the derivative use component of a coextensive grant of immunity is important because it \"[bars] the use of any evidence obtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.\" 406 U.S. at 460. The State\\'s grant of immunity to Delacruz plainly did not include this important component.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t        Curiously, the grant of immunity document refers to the statute dealing with immunities, K.S.A. 22-3415, which specifically refers to use and derivative use immunity under subsection (b)(2). But the immunity document does not purport to incorporate that statutory definition by reference; rather, it recites that the immunity is being granted \"pursuant to the authority vested in me as District Attorney, by K.S.A. 22-3415(a) [and]                                                    16 (c).\" Those subsections, (a) and (c), have nothing to do with the type of immunity being granted. In other words, no reasonable inference on the type of immunity being granted can be discerned from the statutory reference.',\n",
       " \"\\t\\t        To summarize, the State granted Delacruz use immunity; the use immunity granted was not coextensive with Delacruz' constitutional right against self-incrimination; therefore, Judge Chambers' order compelling Delacruz' testimony at the Waller trial violated Delacruz' constitutional right against self-incrimination and was unlawful.

       " '\\t\\t       The Appellant was indicted for violating an order declaring him to be a motor vehicle habitual offender (MVHO), a Class E felony; failing to provide evidence of financial responsibility, a Class C misdemeanor; and passing another vehicle in a no passing zone, a Class C misdemeanor. See Tenn. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 55-10-616; 55-12-139; 55-8-121.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       On September 11, 2015, the State filed a motion in limine asking the trial court to prohibit the Appellant from collaterally attacking the validity of the MVHO order. Citing State v. William Tony Wright, No. M2001-01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, June 19, 2002), the State contended that any argument or testimony suggesting the Appellant had no notice of the MVHO order was misleading because the Appellant had been convicted of violating the MVHO order on three prior occasions; therefore, such argument or testimony was inadmissible.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t        On September 30, 2015, immediately prior to trial, the trial court granted the Stateâ\\x80\\x99s motion. Defense counsel informed the trial court that he did not plan to collaterally attack the MVHO order. Instead, the defense strategy was to show that the State did not introduce proof the Appellant had notice of the MVHO order and that, accordingly, the State could not prove the Appellant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly violated the MVHO order. The State then suggested that the easiest way to establish the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s awareness of the MVHO order was to introduce proof of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s prior convictions of violating the order. Defense counsel responded that the State could prove the Appellant had notice of the order without informing the jury that the Appellant had prior convictions of the same crime, which were â\\x80\\x9cmore prejudicial than probative.â\\x80\\x9d The trial court warned that if the Appellant proceeded with the argument he did not have notice of the MVHO order, it would allow the State to rebut the claim by introducing â\\x80\\x9cdocuments regarding service of process and awareness of court dates.â\\x80\\x9d The State again noted the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s three prior convictions of violating the MVHO order and argued that because of those convictions, the Appellant was prohibited from asserting he had no notice of the order according to case law. The trial court agreed that the State could not â\\x80\\x9ctry the case with its hands behind its back like that,â\\x80\\x9d and reiterated its warning that if defense counsel raised the issue of notice, it would allow the State to rebut the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s claims. Nevertheless, the trial court stated that it would not allow the State to introduce proof of the prior convictions until the Appellant â\\x80\\x9copens that door.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " '\\t\\t        At trial, Chapel Hill Police Officer Andrew Kon testified that at 9:40 p.m. on Tuesday, March 31, 2015, he was driving his marked patrol car north on Highway 31-A in the area of Henry Horton Park when he saw a red Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was traveling southbound pass a blue Ford Expedition. Officer Kon saw the headlights of the Monte Carlo two or three hundred yards in front of his car â\\x80\\x9ccoming towardâ\\x80\\x9d him. Officer Kon said that although it was dark, the double yellow line indicating it was a no passing zone was clearly visible. Officer Kon made a U-turn and activated his patrol carâ\\x80\\x99s blue lights to initiate a traffic stop.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t                                            -2-         The red Monte Carlo stopped in a Dollar General Store parking lot. Officer Kon parked and approached the Appellant, who was the driver. Officer Kon advised the Appellant that he had been stopped for passing another vehicle in a no passing zone. He asked for the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driverâ\\x80\\x99s license, automobile registration, and proof of insurance, but the Appellant did not produce the documents. Officer Kon requested the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s name and date of birth, then he conveyed the information he obtained to the police dispatcher. After receiving a response from the dispatcher, Officer Kon arrested the Appellant for driving on a revoked license, violating a MVHO order, failing to provide proof of financial responsibility, and improper passing. Officer Kon recalled that other vehicles were on the roadway when the Appellant passed the Expedition. On cross-examination, Officer Kon acknowledged that the Appellant did not cause an accident and that no one was injured.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       Nicholas Kiefer testified that he was a deputy clerk in the Davidson County Criminal Court Clerkâ\\x80\\x99s Office and that he was a â\\x80\\x9ckeeper of the records.â\\x80\\x9d From the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s file, Kiefer identified a certified copy of an â\\x80\\x9cOrder to Appear . . . in an habitual offender matter.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer explained that according to the order, the Appellant was ordered â\\x80\\x9cto appear before the criminal court on the 19th of January, 2005, to show cause why he should not be declared an habitual traffic offender.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer said that on the second page of the order was a â\\x80\\x9ccertificate of service from the deputy sheriff.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer identified another order by the Davidson County Criminal Court, which stated that the Appellant was declared to be an habitual traffic offender. The order, which was dated January 20, 2005, prohibited the Appellant from driving for three years and ordered that he surrender his license to the court. On the second page of the order was a signed certificate of service reflecting that a â\\x80\\x9ctrue and exact copyâ\\x80\\x9d of the order had been â\\x80\\x9cmailed or hand-deliveredâ\\x80\\x9d to the Appellant â\\x80\\x9cand/orâ\\x80\\x9d his attorney. Kiefer also identified a â\\x80\\x9ccertified copy of what we call a file jacket. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the front of the file that â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s the front of what would be a criminal case file.â\\x80\\x9d He explained that â\\x80\\x9conly two specific clerksâ\\x80\\x9d in the office made notations on the front of the file jacket. The grand jury clerk wrote the case number, the division assignment, and the reason for the case. The â\\x80\\x9cjudgeâ\\x80\\x99s in-court clerkâ\\x80\\x9d wrote the date of the docket and â\\x80\\x9cnotations similar to what would be on a minute entry.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer examined the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s file jacket and noticed that the first date listed was January 19, 2005. Kiefer said, â\\x80\\x9cThe notation for that day states that the [Appellant], Mr. William Hanson, was served and that the case was reset.â\\x80\\x9d The next date listed was January 20, 2005, which was the same date the MVHO order was entered.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t        On cross-examination, Kiefer acknowledged that he began working in the clerkâ\\x80\\x99s office in 2011 and that he was not present for any of the 2005 court proceedings.                                             -3-         Glendora Graves testified that she was a district manager with the Tennessee Department of Safety and Homeland Security. Through her employment, she had access to driving histories. In preparation for trial, she accessed the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving history, which included a January 20, 2005 order declaring the Appellant to be a MVHO. The order resulted in the revocation of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s license. Graves stated that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges were never restored and that the order was in effect on the day of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s arrest. On cross-examination, Graves acknowledged that the branch of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security which was responsible for maintaining driving records was located in Nashville. She further acknowledged that she did not maintain the driving records. She also acknowledged that sometimes a driving record contained incorrect information but that it did not happen often. On redirect examination, Graves asserted that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record had â\\x80\\x9cbeen certified as true and accurate by Susan Lowe of the financial responsibility division.â\\x80\\x9d',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       The jury convicted the Appellant as charged. On appeal, the Appellant contends that the trial court erred by granting the Stateâ\\x80\\x99s motion to prohibit the Appellant from collaterally attacking the motor vehicle habitual offender order, by limiting the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s closing argument, and by admitting the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record into evidence through Stateâ\\x80\\x99s witness from the Department of Safety and Homeland Security. The Appellant also contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for violating an order declaring him to be a motor vehicle habitual offender.',\n",

       " 'TRUE\\tDK\\tA. Collateral Attack on MVHO Order',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       As his first issue, the Appellant contends that he â\\x80\\x9cmakes a good faith argument for [a] change in the law thus allowing this case to be remanded to allow collateral attack on the Davidson County [MVHO] Order.â\\x80\\x9d In the trial court, the Appellant repeatedly asserted that he was not collaterally attacking the MVHO order and was instead claiming that the State failed to prove he received notice of the order and thus failed to prove he violated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. On appeal, however, the Appellant concedes that he is collaterally attacking the MVHO order.1 The Appellant contends that the trial court misconstrued State v. William Tony Wright, No. M2001-',\n",
       " '\\t\\t        1          We caution that â\\x80\\x9can appellant is bound by the evidentiary theory set forth at trial, and may not change theories on appeal.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Alder, 71 S.W.3d 299, 303 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001).                                                   -4- 01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, June 19, 2002), as authority to grant the Stateâ\\x80\\x99s motion in limine restricting collateral attack on the MVHO order. He maintains that Wright did not stand for the proposition that a defendant could not collaterally attack an MVHO order. The Appellant did not cite any other cases in support of his contention. The Appellant contends that the trial courtâ\\x80\\x99s erroneous ruling limited his ability to argue that the State had failed to prove that the Appellant knew about the MVHO order and, accordingly, that the Appellant could not have violated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       This court has explained previously that â\\x80\\x9c[a] proceeding under the Motor Vehicle Habitual Offender Act is civil in nature and therefore is governed by the Tennessee Rules of Civil Procedure.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Malady, 952 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996). As the State notes, this court has held consistently that a defendant cannot collaterally attack an order declaring him to be a MVHO. See Davis v. State, 793 S.W.2d 650, 651 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1990); Everhart v. State, 563 S.W.2d 795, 797-98 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978); State v. Tony Lynn Allen, No. M2007-00826-CCA-R3-CD, 2008 WL 2743882, at *3 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, July 15, 2008); State v. Nelson Keith Foster, No. E2001- 02976-CCA-RM-CD, 2002 WL 181359, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, Feb. 1, 2002); State v. Michael Samuel Eidson, No. 03C01-9711-CR-00506, 1999 WL 160944, at *1 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Knoxville, Mar. 24, 1999). Instead, â\\x80\\x9cthe appropriate procedure for challenging a habitual [motor vehicle] offender order is to file a motion pursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Ernest Michael Turner, No. W2006-02661-CCA-R3-CD, 2008 WL 1700338, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Jackson, Apr. 4, 2008) (citing Bankston v. State, 815 S.W.2d 213, 216 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991)).We agree with the State that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s arguments regarding Wright are â\\x80\\x9cnot entirely accurate.â\\x80\\x9d The Appellant contends that the defendant in Wright was allowed to collaterally attack the MVHO order. However, in Wright, the defendant pled guilty to violating an MVHO order. Wright, No. M2001-01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655, at *1. Thereafter, he filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea, arguing that he was â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98legally innocentâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d of the violation because the order did not comply with Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 58. Id. Simultaneously, the defendant filed a motion challenging the MVHO order under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02. Id. at *2. On appeal, this court determined that the defendantâ\\x80\\x99s issues turned upon whether he was entitled to relief under Rule 60.02 and, after consideration, held that â\\x80\\x9cthe trial court did not err in denying [the defendantâ\\x80\\x99s] motion for relief from the order declaring him to be a motor vehicle habitual offender.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at *4.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t      The record before us does not reflect that the Appellant ever filed a motion pursuant to Rule 60.02 challenging the MVHO order, and he has not filed such a motion in the instant case. Moreover, the State did not argue that Wright stood for the proposition that an MVHO order could not be collaterally attacked; instead, the State                                             -5- cited Wright to support the proposition that a defendant who had pled guilty to violating the MVHO order previously consequently has notice of the order. We agree. The Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s arguments are unavailing.',\n",
       " 'TRUE\\tARGUMENT\\tB. Closing Argument',\n",
       " '\\t\\t        The Appellant next contends that the trial court erred by limiting defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s ability to argue during closing argument that the State introduced no proof the Appellant had notice of the MVHO order and that, accordingly, he could not have intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly violated the order. The State responds that the Appellant is not entitled to relief on this issue.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t        It is well-established that closing argument is an important tool for both parties during a trial; thus, counsel is generally given wide latitude during closing argument, and the trial court is granted wide discretion in controlling closing arguments. See State v. Carruthers, 35 S.W.3d 516, 577-78 (Tenn. 2000) (appendix). â\\x80\\x9cNotwithstanding such, arguments must be temperate, based upon the evidence introduced at trial, relevant to the issues being tried, and not otherwise improper under the facts or law.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Goltz, 111 S.W.3d 1, 5 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2003).',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       The record reflects that during closing argument, defense counsel acknowledged that the State had shown the jury the MVHO order but argued that it was required also to prove that the Appellant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly violated the order. Defense counsel told the jury that all three mental states â\\x80\\x9crequire [the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s] knowledge. That he knew this [order] existed.â\\x80\\x9d Defense counsel contended, however, the State presented no witnesses who testified that they saw the order being given to the Appellant or that he was in court the day the order was issued. The State objected to defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s argument as a collateral attack on the MVHO order after the proof was closed. Defense counsel responded that he was not arguing that the order was invalid. The trial court said that it was being â\\x80\\x9cliberalâ\\x80\\x9d with defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s argument but cautioned that if defense counsel went â\\x80\\x9ctoo far,â\\x80\\x9d it would let the State respond â\\x80\\x9cwithin the confines of the proof.â\\x80\\x9d The trial court agreed that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s prior convictions were not part of the proof; nevertheless, the court observed that defense counsel was attempting to â\\x80\\x9csand bagâ\\x80\\x9d the State by claiming the Appellant had no notice of the MVHO order after the proof was closed in order to render the State unable to rebut the claim.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       Defense counsel maintained that the State could have introduced the minutes or transcript of the MVHO hearing or called the district attorney who prosecuted that case to prove the Appellant had knowledge of the MVHO order. However, the trial court responded that the State was not required to go to such lengths to prove the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s knowledge of the order and that it was â\\x80\\x9cdis[i]ngenuousâ\\x80\\x9d for defense counsel to argue that the Appellant did not have notice of the MVHO order. The trial court allowed defense                                            -6- counsel to argue â\\x80\\x9cabout what is on the orderâ\\x80\\x9d but refused to let him argue that the Appellant did not have notice of the order. The court cautioned that if defense counsel persisted in his argument, the court might â\\x80\\x9chave to craft a specific instruction,â\\x80\\x9d noting that the standard MVHO instruction did not explain that the State did not â\\x80\\x9chave to prove a negative. They have to prove there was an order and he drove.â\\x80\\x9d Initially, we note that the Appellant failed to cite any authority in support of his argument that the trial court erred by limiting his closing argument. Generally, â\\x80\\x9c[i]ssues which are not supported by argument, citation to authorities, or appropriate references to the record will be treated as waived in this court.â\\x80\\x9d Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b); see Tenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7). Further, the Appellant argues that the trial court warned defense counsel that if he â\\x80\\x9ccontinued this sort of argument, that the Court would allow the State to present to the jury evidence to show the [Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s] knowledge of the [MVHO] order.â\\x80\\x9d The Appellant provided no citation to the record where the court issued the foregoing warning. Our review of the record reveals that the trial court issued no such warning; instead, the trial court told the Appellant that it would allow the State to â\\x80\\x9cdo what they have got to do within the confines of the proofâ\\x80\\x9d and that the trial court would fashion a special jury instruction to inform the jury that the State did not have to prove the Appellant was in court on the day the MVHO order was issued.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       Moreover, once defense counsel continued his closing argument, he argued to the jury that the certificate of service on the second page of the MVHO order was â\\x80\\x9cpro formaâ\\x80\\x9d and did not specify the method in which the order may have been delivered to the Appellant. Defense counsel also argued that Kiefer did not work at the court at the time the order was issued and therefore could not testify specifically about how the Appellant received the order, whether it was mailed or hand-delivered, and could not assert that the Appellant definitively had received the order. Although defense counsel was allowed to make this argument, it was inappropriate and an attempt to collaterally attack the underlying judgment. The Appellant is not entitled to relief on this issue.',\n",
       " 'TRUE\\tTESTIMONY\\tC. Gravesâ\\x80\\x99s Testimony',\n",
       " '\\t\\t\\t       As his next issue, the Appellant argues that Graves was not qualified to testify about his driving record because she was not the keeper of the records at the Department of Safety and Homeland Security and that the driving record was not a self-authenticating document. He complains that the trial court required the Appellant to choose between allowing Graves to testify that his driving privileges had not been reinstated since the MVHO order or allowing the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s redacted driving history to be entered into evidence as a self-authenticating document. The State responds that the Appellant has waived the issue by failing to include the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record in the appellate record for our review. In the alternative, the State argues that the trial court did not err by limiting Gravesâ\\x80\\x99s testimony to whether the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges had been reinstated. We agree with the State. During a jury-out hearing, the State announced that it intended to call Glendora Graves as the keeper of the records of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security. She said that her department was responsible for issuing driverâ\\x80\\x99s licenses and keeping information regarding driverâ\\x80\\x99s histories. Graves asserted that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving history reflected that his driverâ\\x80\\x99s license had been revoked and had never been reinstated.',\n",
       " 'TRUE\\tSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\tII. STATEMENT OF FACTS',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       Defense counsel objected to Graves being allowed to testify, arguing that although she could access the records, she was not the keeper of the records. The trial court asked whether the records were self-authenticating. The State responded that the records were self-authenticating.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t        We are unable to address any of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s concerns regarding whether the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record was self-authenticating because the Appellant failed to include the driving record in the appellate record for our review. The Appellant carries the burden of ensuring that the record on appeal conveys a fair, accurate, and complete account of what has transpired with respect to those issues that are the bases of appeal. Tenn. R. App. P. 24(b); see also Thompson v. State, 958 S.W.2d 156, 172 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1997). â\\x80\\x9cIn the absence of an adequate record on appeal, this court must presume that the trial courtâ\\x80\\x99s rulings were supported by sufficient evidence.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Oody, 823 S.W.2d 554, 559 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991). Accordingly, the Appellant is not entitled to relief on this issue.',\n",
       " 'TRUE\\tDK\\tD. Sufficiency of the Evidence',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       As his final issue, the Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence sustaining his conviction for violating the MVHO order, asserting that the State failed to prove that he violated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. The State responds that the proof was sufficient. On appeal, a jury conviction removes the presumption of the appellantâ\\x80\\x99s innocence and replaces it with one of guilt, so that the appellant carries the burden of demonstrating to this court why the evidence will not support the juryâ\\x80\\x99s findings. See State v. Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). The appellant must establish that no reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential elements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt.

In other words, questions concerning the                                              -8- credibility of witnesses and the weight and value to be given the evidence, as well as all factual issues raised by the evidence, are resolved by the trier of fact, and not the appellate courts.

Even though convictions may be established by different forms of evidence, the standard of review for the sufficiency of that evidence is the same whether the conviction is based upon direct or circumstantial evidence.

Accordingly, the trial court instructed the jury several times duringthe course of the trial that the testimony of various witnesses would beconsidered only for purposes of Matt and had no bearing on Appellant\\'s case.We have held \"[a] jury is presumed to follow an admonition to disregardevidence and the admonition thus cures any error.\" Johnson v.Commonwealth, 105 S.W.3d 430, 441 (Ky. 2003). The only argument Appellantmakes to this court to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trialcourt\\'s admonitions is that the jury recommended the maximum sentence foreach of his charges and recommended that those sentences run consecutivelyto one another.Appellant points out that Matt was charged with thirteen countsunrelated to the sodomy charge for which both brothers were jointly indicted.He insists that the testimony solely related to Matt\\'s sexual abuse and use of aminor in a sexual performance charges was often extremely inflammatory.Specifically, Appellant claims that Matt was tried for an additional indictmentof first-degree sodomy \"of a separate child in which [Appellant] was not allegedto have been involved.\" However, this claim is patently false.

Commonwealth, 858 S.W.2d 185,187 (Ky. 1993), that \"[a] significant factor in identifying such prejudice is theextent to which evidence of one offense would be admissible in a trial of theother offense,\" Appellant argues that because none of the evidence presentedagainst Matt in the charges stemming from his second indictment would beadmissible in Appellant\\'s trial, this created sufficient prejudice. However, asstated above (and as Appellant acknowledges), we will not overturn the decisionof the trial court absent a showing that it abused its discretion. \"The test forabuse of discretion is whether the trial judge\\'s decision was arbitrary,unreasonable, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles.\"Commonwealth v. English, 993 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Ky. 1999).As to the brothers\\' sodomy charge, Sam testified in graphic detail abouthis father and uncle anally raping him. Sam testified that his father had firstsodomized him when he was in first or second grade. He went on to testify thatwhen he was in third grade, his father and Matt took turns having sex withhim in the bathroom of the mobile home Sam lived in with his parents andseven siblings. When the Commonwealth asked what he meant by hisstatement that Appellant and Matt had sex with him, Sam responded that hemeant that they stuck their penises in his butt. Clearly, so far as the chargesarising from Appellant and Matt\\'s sodomy of Sam, the brothers were \"alleged tohave participated in the same act or transaction . . . constituting an offense\"',\n",

All of the \"evidence of one offense would be admissible in atrial of the other offense.\" Rearick, 858 S.W.2d at 187. Therefore, the trialcourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant\\'s motion for severanceof the charges included in the same indictment.The charges arising from Matt\\'s separate indictment are a bit moreproblematic. Under that indictment, Matt was charged with six counts of first-degree sexual abuse and seven counts of use of a minor in a sexualperformance. The alleged victims were six of Appellant\\'s children, includingSam, and Appellant\\'s step-daughter, Suzie. In addition to Sam and Suzie,three of Appellant\\'s other children testified about Matt touching theminappropriately, or about seeing Matt touch their siblings or step-sisterinappropriately. While the evidence of these other charges would not havebeen admissible in Appellant\\'s trial, we have reviewed the trial record at lengthand are satisfied with the admonitions the trial court gave the jury. In eachinstance, the jury was instructed to only consider the testimony as it related toMatt and not to use it against Appellant in any way. Appellant does notattempt to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trial court\\'sadmonitions.Appellant also complains that a statement a witness (Matt\\'s ex-girlfriend)made prejudiced him.

We note again that \"[a] jury ispresumed to follow an admonition to disregard evidence and the admonitionthus cures any error.\" Johnson 105 S.W.3d at 441. \"Nor does [Appellant]present any argument to rebut the presumption that the trial court\\'sadmonition cured the error,\" Mills v.

As such, we hold that the trial court\\'s admonitions cured any errorresulting from the joinder of Appellant\\'s and Matt\\'s indictments.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t      Furthermore, Appellant\\'s argument that the evidence should not havebeen admitted, as \"unless a collateral act has some direct relationship to thecharge being tried, its admission necessarily depends on the view that thedefendant\\'s character and predisposition are probative of his guilt,\" Rearick,858 S.W.2d at 187, is without merit. None of the complained of testimony wasadmitted against Appellant; but, rather, it was admitted against Matt and thejury was specifically directed not to use it in any way against Appellant.',\n",
       " \"\\t\\t      As to Appellant's contention that his sentence reflects the fact thatevidence of his brother's crimes prejudiced the jury against him, we point outthat the most inflammatory witness statements in the case would have come inas evidence in Appellant's trial regardless of whether it was joined with hisbrother's.

While the evidence againstMatt included testimony by several of the children that he had fondled theirbreasts and/or genital areas inside or outside their clothing or exposed himselfto the children or had the children disrobe for him, the trial court admonishedthe jury not to consider this evidence against Appellant. We believe that thefact that two child witnesses testified that Appellant had anally raped themâ\\x80\\x94and the fact Appellant served as a father figure to both of themâ\\x80\\x94is enough toaccount for the jury's recommended sentence without accounting for anyalleged prejudice.\",\n",

We disagree. The sexual actâ\\x80\\x94anal sodomyâ\\x80\\x94was the same in bothinstances. The fact that Suzie happened to be female did not alter the type ofsexual act Appellant subjected her to.

However, it is not the sole determining       factor. While temporal remoteness tends to lessen the probative       value of the evidence of Appellee\\'s prior sexual misconduct, its       probativeness is conversely heightened by the multiplicity of       victims, the multiplicity of occurrences, and the fact that the abuse       was perpetrated against members of several generations of the       same family.

The shooter asked Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s brother if he was Flowers, and when the brother saidno, the shooter departed. Soon the shooter returned, asked Flowers â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s up?â\\x80\\x9d and fatally shotFlowers. R. 16 (06/16/03 Trial Tr., Dequan Flowers at 159â\\x80\\x9361). Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s mother, Emma Flowers,and her neighbor, Lucretia Adams (Adams), told an officer that they suspected Willie James Jones,whom they knew by the nickname â\\x80\\x9cNookie.â\\x80\\x9dMcLister Trice was the link between Flowers and Jones. She had dated and had a child withJones, and dated Flowers from October 2000 to January 2001. After breaking up with Flowers threeweeks before the murder, Trice filed several police reports about Flowers vandalizing her car andstalking her. She also obtained a personal protective order against him. Tensions escalated in earlyFebruary 2001, when Flowers followed Trice into a liquor store. Jones was with Trice, and anargument ensued. Flowers struck Triceâ\\x80\\x99s head, and in return Trice hit Flowers with a wine bottle.Flowers ran from the store and told his companion, Jeff Adams, that Flowers had punched Jones andthat Jones had a gun. Jeff Adams testified to these facts, though he had not witnessed the fight.Trice, however, insisted that Jones was not involved and did not have a gun.Around 10 a.m. on the morning of the shooting, Trice drove to the home of her stepmother,Patricia Wilson. Flowers, who lived across the street, approached Triceâ\\x80\\x99s car and punched herwindow. Adams testified that she overheard Trice tell Flowers â\\x80\\x9cB----, you going to die today. Nook-- my baby daddy Nook is setting it up now.â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03 Trial Tr., Adams at 113). EmmaFlowersâ\\x80\\x99s testimony was substantially similar. Id. (E.

Trice deniedmaking these statements, and Jones denied telling Trice that he planned to kill Flowers.                                                  2        Afterward, Trice called her stepmother, Patricia Wilson. Wilson later testified that Trice toldher about the incident with Flowers and â\\x80\\x9cthat Nook was going to take care of it that day.â\\x80\\x9d Id.(Wilson at 103).Around noon, Jones stopped by Triceâ\\x80\\x99s workplace. Trice told Jones and other people aboutthe encounter with Flowers. Around 4 p.m., Jones called Trice to say that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had beentaken care of.â\\x80\\x9d Id. (Trice at 40).

The trial court withheld judgment on whether the evidencecould be introduced to impeach Trice. The court also excluded Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s testimony that Trice hadtold her that Jones would take care of Triceâ\\x80\\x99s problem with Flowers.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       The evidentiary issue reemerged at trial. On direct examination, Trice could not recall thetime at which she spoke to Jones. The government referenced a statement that Trice had given topolice after the shooting when she had been arrested for her own alleged involvement. Thegovernment offered the statement to Trice to refresh her recollection. Trice then testified that, at 4                                                   3 p.m., Jones had said â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been taken care ofâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c[h]e already paid someone.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at40. The government asked whether Trice had said anything to Flowers that morning, but the judgesent the jury away before Trice answered. The judge informed the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s counsel that itwould not permit questioning on an irrelevant point as a means of creating an innocuousinconsistency from which to introduce Emma Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s and Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s statements â\\x80\\x9cunder the guiseof impeachment.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 47. The judge then cautioned the defense attorney to constrain herquestions to avoid â\\x80\\x9copen[ing] the door for the admission . . . of the heretofore barred . . . statements.â\\x80\\x9dId. at 56â\\x80\\x9357.On cross-examination, Trice claimed that she did not know what Jones was talking aboutwhen he mentioned paying someone to take care of an order. Defense counsel also asked a seriesof questions to undermine the credibility of Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statement to the police: she had been arrested,was poorly treated, did not write the statement herself, and signed it while scared, threatened, andhungry. Based on this latter set of questions, the trial court ruled that defense counsel had openedthe door to the hearsay statements, permitting the government to rehabilitate Trice with herconsistent, pre-arrest statements. Wilson, Emma Flowers, and Adams testified to the statementsâ\\x80\\x9cthat Nook was going to take care of it that day,â\\x80\\x9d id. (Wilson at 103), and â\\x80\\x9c[b]----, you going to dietoday. Nook -- my baby daddy Nook is setting it up now,â\\x80\\x9d id. (Adams at 113); see also id. (E.Flowers at 132). Defense counsel objected specifically to Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s testimony but the judge admittedit both as a prior consistent statement and for impeachment. The attorney did not request a limitinginstruction.                                                     4The jury convicted Jones of second-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degreemurder, and solicitation of first-degree murder. He is serving concurrent sentences of lifeimprisonment for conspiracy, nineteen-to-thirty years of imprisonment for second-degree murder,and nineteen-to-thirty years of imprisonment for solicitation of first-degree murder. The MichiganCourt of Appeals affirmed the convictions, People v. Jones, No. 250326, 2005 WL 657578 (Mich.Ct. App. March 22, 2005) (unpublished opinion), and the Michigan Supreme Court declined leaveto appeal. Following his direct appeal, Jones filed his habeas petition with the district court.

First, he asserts that hisattorney provided ineffective assistance by opening the door for Triceâ\\x80\\x99s prior statements to come intoevidence by discrediting Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statement to the police, even though her statement to the police wasnot actually admitted into evidence. Second, he complains that his attorney did not request that thejudge instruct the jury to consider Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s, Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s, and Emma Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s testimony only for itsimpeachment value. To succeed on his ineffective-assistance claim, Jones must show that the statecourts unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), which requires both deficient performance and prejudice to the defense. Attorney performance is deficient ifâ\\x80\\x9ccounselâ\\x80\\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonablenessâ\\x80\\x9d by making â\\x80\\x9cerrors soserious that counsel was not functioning as the â\\x80\\x98counselâ\\x80\\x99 guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment.â\\x80\\x9dId. at 687â\\x80\\x9388. â\\x80\\x9cOur review of counselâ\\x80\\x99s performance is highly deferential and counsel is stronglypresumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise ofreasonable professional judgment.â\\x80\\x9d Johnson v.

       " 'TRUE\\tJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\\t1. Opening the Door For Prejudicial Hearsay',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       Opening the door to damaging testimony can constitute deficient performance. See, e.g.,White v. Thaler, 610 F.3d 890, 900 (5th Cir. 2010). Here, however, the Michigan Court of Appealsfound that opening the door was a necessary consequence of the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s much-needed attack onTriceâ\\x80\\x99s credibility. That consequence was damaging, but we consider it in context, alongside thebeneficial results of the strategy and in light of counselâ\\x80\\x99s slim options. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539 U.S. 510, 523 (2003) (using â\\x80\\x9ca context-dependent consideration of the challenged [attorney] conductâ\\x80\\x9d).On direct examination, Trice had testified to Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s statements that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had beentaken care of,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c[h]e already paid someone,â\\x80\\x9d and he had done â\\x80\\x9c[w]hat you thought.â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03Trial Tr., Trice at 40, 44). Although Triceâ\\x80\\x99s police statement had not been admitted into evidence,the jury was aware of her statement to police because the prosecution had referenced it whenrefreshing Triceâ\\x80\\x99s recollection. Jones admits that direct examination implied that the police reportwas consistent with Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statements. Doing nothing to counter these damaging claims andimplications on cross-examination would not have been a wise choice, despite what Jones arguesnow. The Michigan Court of Appeals did not unreasonably determine that, â\\x80\\x9c[b]ecause of the natureof [Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statements on direct], defense counsel would have been remiss not to address thestatements on cross-examination and attempt to explain them.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578, at *3.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       Debunking the police report removed any enhanced credibility that the police report hadadded to Triceâ\\x80\\x99s testimony. Jones argues that his attorney performed deficiently because she acted                                                  7 on the false belief that the police report was in evidence. But his attorney explicitly confirmed herunderstanding that the statement was not in evidence. R. 17 at 79 (â\\x80\\x9cTHE COURT: â\\x80\\x98You know, herstatement is actually not in evidence, [defense counsel]. Her trial testimony is.â\\x80\\x99 [DEFENSECOUNSEL]: â\\x80\\x98I understand.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d). Defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s cross-examination was directed at â\\x80\\x9cwhat theprosecutor said when he was asking [Trice] questions. He asked about her [police] statement, whatshe said in her statement.â\\x80\\x9d Id.Some portions of the cross-examination strategy did not depend on the police report. Forexample, the defense attorney extracted from Trice that she did not know what Jones was talkingabout when he referenced the order that he had taken care of or when he said that he had paidsomeone. The judge had warned the defense attorney about the risk of opening the door topreviously excluded testimony. In hindsight, perhaps refraining from asking about the police reportwould have been a better strategy. But given the deference with which we review attorney decisions,we cannot say that the state courts were unreasonable in concluding that the choice was notconstitutionally deficient. The circumstances of the police reportâ\\x80\\x94Triceâ\\x80\\x99s own arrest as well as hermaltreatmentâ\\x80\\x94make her statements dubious. That line of questioning may have had more force thandid Triceâ\\x80\\x99s admission that she felt that Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s statements were ambiguous. Also, each of thehearsay statements relies on Triceâ\\x80\\x99s credibility as a declarant. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s trial counsel reasonably mighthave decided that the benefit of casting doubt on Triceâ\\x80\\x99s testimony outweighed the harm of newwitnesses testifying to statements similar to what that the jury had already heard.                                                   8        The Michigan Court of Appeals held that â\\x80\\x9c[c]ounselâ\\x80\\x99s strategy was clearly to try to show thatTrice did not know what defendant meant by the statements. Given counselâ\\x80\\x99s limited options, thisstrategy was not unsound.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578, at *3. The attorneyâ\\x80\\x99s strategy was somewhatbroader in that it probed the circumstances of the police report, but the state court was notunreasonable in determining that the attorney exercised professional judgment and providedconstitutionally adequate assistance.

Davis, 886 F.2d 777, 782 (6th Cir. 1989) (holding that we may not â\\x80\\x9cindependentlyevaluate the scope of the Tennessee statutes here, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals and[Tennessee] Supreme Court having already held that the legislature intended cumulativepunishmentsâ\\x80\\x9d).1 â\\x80\\x9c[T]he fact that the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s interpretation of state law happens to be central Jones points to language in Banner limiting its relevance when the state courts â\\x80\\x9cfailed to give a clear expression on the issue of cumulative punishment.â\\x80\\x9d Banner, 886 F.2d at 782. Banner used that language to distinguish Pryor v. Rose, 724 F.2d 525 (6th Cir. 1984) (en banc), an opinion                                                   10 to the double jeopardy analysis does not permit us to review the [Michigan] Court of Appealsâ\\x80\\x99construction of [its own] law.â\\x80\\x9d McCloud, 409 F.3d at 875. It does not matter, as Jones argues, thatthe state appellate decision was not precedential or that only a stateâ\\x80\\x99s supreme court can issue abinding interpretation of state law. The state courtâ\\x80\\x99s decision of state law is not cognizable onhabeas review.',\n",
       " '\\t\\t       Jones cites Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 (1977), as an example of the Supreme Court reviewing the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s reasoning on a double jeopardy claim. In that case, the Court said thatit â\\x80\\x9cagree[d] with the Ohio Court of Appeals that joyriding and auto theft, as defined by the [state]court, constitute the same statutory offense within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.â\\x80\\x9d Id.at 168. Put differently, the Court agreed that, given the lack of legislative authorization for multiplepunishments, the convictions in Brown violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.A multiple-punishments challenge takes root only if the legislature did not authorize multiple punishments.When it has, there is no federal issue with which a federal court can agree or disagree. See Banner,886 F.2d at 782 (rejecting the reading of Brown advocated by Jones).In this case, we must accept the Michigan Court of Appealsâ\\x80\\x99 construction of the Michigan statutes: the murder statute â\\x80\\x9cprotect[s] human life and prohibit[s] wrongful slayingsâ\\x80\\x9d; the conspiracy statute â\\x80\\x9cprotect[s] society from the increased danger presented by group activityâ\\x80\\x9d; and the solicitation that did not make clear howâ\\x80\\x94or whetherâ\\x80\\x94the state court had decided the double-jeopardy question. Banner, 886 F.2d at 782 & n.2. The Banner panel resolved the confusion by holding that we must defer to state-court holdings when the state â\\x80\\x9ccourts have carefully considered and analyzed the scope of the [state] statutes.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 782. The Michigan Court of Appeals did so in this case, and we are bound by Banner.',\n",

A federal court reviewing a habeas petition may not, as Jones requests, reexamine the role ofMichiganâ\\x80\\x99s rule of lenity, the level of generality at which to examine the purpose of each statute, orwhether Michiganâ\\x80\\x99s legislature intended to punish a single act of procurement under three statutes.Given the distinct purposes of the statutes of conviction, there is no colorable argument that theDouble Jeopardy Clause protects Jones from being convicted under all three statutes.',\n",

Konteh, 567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1081 (2010).Id. (citations omitted). Jones challenges each of his three convictions, but he disputes the sufficiencyof the evidence only as to (1) his intent and (2) his performance of acts that assisted in or hisencouragement of the murder. Sufficient evidence supports both elements.',\n",

       " '\\t\\t        One element of second-degree murder is the â\\x80\\x9cintent to kill, . . . inflict great bodily harm, or. . . create a very high risk of death with the knowledge that the act probably will cause death or greatbodily harm.â\\x80\\x9d People v. Bailey, 549 N.W.2d 325, 331 (Mich. 1996). Under an aiding-and-abettingtheory of liability, the intent component is satisfied by, among other options, proof that â\\x80\\x9cthedefendant intended the commission of the crime.â\\x80\\x9d People v. Robinson, 715 N.W.2d 44, 47â\\x80\\x9348(Mich. 2006) (internal quotation and alteration marks removed). â\\x80\\x9c[I]nten[t] that a murder would infact be committedâ\\x80\\x9d is also an element of solicitation to commit murder. People v. Crawford, 591 N.W.2d 669, 673 (Mich. Ct. App. 1998). Similarly, conspiracy requires specific intent â\\x80\\x9cto combinewith othersâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cto accomplish the illegal objective.â\\x80\\x9d People v. Carter, 330 N.W.2d 314, 319(Mich. 1982), overruled in part on other grounds, People v. Robideau, 55 N.W.2d 592 (Mich. 1984).In this case, a jury could reasonably find that Jones intended to have the victim killed and intendedto make an agreement to kill the victim. Adams and Emma Flowers both testified that, based on thestatement that they overheard Trice make, Jones was arranging to have the victim killed. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99sstatements to Triceâ\\x80\\x94that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been taken care of,â\\x80\\x9d that he had â\\x80\\x9cpaid the n-----,â\\x80\\x9d and,when asked â\\x80\\x9cwhether he had anything to do withâ\\x80\\x9d the victimâ\\x80\\x99s death, he responded â\\x80\\x9c[w]hat youthought,â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03 Trial Tr., Trice at 40, 42â\\x80\\x9345)â\\x80\\x94could be interpreted as evidence of intent.The liquor-store conflict and Triceâ\\x80\\x99s difficulties with the victim also supply limited circumstantialsupport. Resolving factual disputes in favor of the prosecution, we cannot conclude that it wasunreasonable for the Michigan Court of Appeals to determine that a rational trier of fact could findthat Jones had intended to kill Flowers.',\n",
