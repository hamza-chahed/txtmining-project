A jury\\n\\ntrial was conducted in May of 1999, after which Petitioner was found guilty as charged.\\n\\nThe state trial court sentenced Petitioner to a term of life imprisonment. Petitioner\\n\\nappealed, and the Fifth District Court of Appeal of Florida affirmed on July 9, 1999. See\\nNieves v. State, 739 So. 2d 125 (Fla. 5th DCA 1999). Petitioner filed a motion for rehearing,\\n\\nwhich was denied on August 17, 1999. (App. A at 85.) Petitioner filed a notice to invoke\\n\\ndiscretionary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Florida, which denied the request on\\n\\nJanuary 18, 2000. Id. at 88.\\n\\n       Petitioner filed a Florida Rule of Criminal Procedure 3.850 motion for post-\\n\\nconviction relief on January 16, 2002.1 (App. D at 14.) The state trial court summarily\\n\\ndenied the motion without prejudice. Id. at 56-57. Petitioner filed a notice of supplemental\\n\\nappellate record and reassertion of motion for post-conviction relief. Id. at 58-60. The state\\n\\ntrial court summarily denied the Rule 3.850 motion on June 14, 2004.

Legal Standards\\n\\n       A.     Exhaustion and Procedural Default\\n\\n       One procedural requirement set forth in the AEDPA precludes federal courts, absent\\n\\nexceptional circumstances, from granting habeas relief unless the petitioner has exhausted\\n\\nall means of available relief under state law. 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2254(b); Oâ\\x80\\x99Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526\\n\\nU.S. 838, 842-22 (1999); Picard v. Connor, 404 U.S. 270, 275 (1971). Specifically, the AEDPA\\n\\nprovides, in pertinent part:\\n\\n       An application for a writ of habeas corpus on behalf of a person in custody\\n       pursuant to the judgment of a State court shall not be granted unless it\\n       appears thatâ\\x80\\x93\\n\\n             (A)    the applicant has exhausted the remedies available in the\\n                     courts of the State; or\\n\\n             (B)    (i)       there is an absence of available State corrective process;\\n                               or\\n\\n                    (ii)      circumstances exist that render such process ineffective\\n                               to protect the rights of the applicant.\\n\\n28 U.S.C. Â§ 2254(b)(1).\\n\\n       Thus, a federal court must dismiss those claims or portions of claims that have been\\n\\ndenied on adequate and independent procedural grounds under state law. Coleman v.\\n\\nThompson, 501 U.S. 722, 750 (1991). In addition, a federal habeas court is precluded from\\n\\nconsidering claims that are not exhausted but would clearly be barred if returned to state\\n\\ncourt. Id. at 735 n.1 (stating that if the petitioner failed to exhaust state remedies and the\\n\\ncourt to which the petitioner would be required to present his claims in order to meet the\\n\\nexhaustion requirement would now find the claims procedurally barred, there is a\\n\\n                                                3\\n\\nprocedural default for federal habeas purposes regardless of the decision of the last state\\n\\ncourt to which the petitioner actually presented his claims).\\n\\n       In order to satisfy the exhaustion requirement, a state petitioner must â\\x80\\x9cfairly\\n\\npresen[t] federal claims to the state courts in order to give the State the opportunity to pass\\n\\nupon and correct alleged violations of its prisonersâ\\x80\\x99 federal rights.â\\x80\\x9d Duncan v. Henry, 513\\n\\nU.S. 364, 365 (1995) (citing Picard, 404 U.S. at 275-76) (internal quotation marks omitted).\\n\\nThe petitioner must apprise the state court of the federal constitutional issue, not just the\\n\\nunderlying facts of the claim or a similar state law claim. Snowden v. Singletary, 135 F.3d\\n\\n732 (11th Cir. 1998). The United States Supreme Court has observed that â\\x80\\x9cCongress surely\\n\\nmeant that exhaustion be serious and meaningful.â\\x80\\x9d Keeney v. Tamayo-Reyes, 504 U.S. 1, 10\\n\\n(1992). Furthermore, the Court explained:\\n\\n       [c]omity concerns dictate that the requirement of exhaustion is not satisfied\\n       by the mere statement of a federal claim in state court. Just as the State must\\n       afford the petitioner a full and fair hearing on his federal claim, so must the\\n       petitioner afford the State a full and fair opportunity to address and resolve\\n       the claims on the merits.\\n\\nId.; see also Henderson v. Campbell, 353 F.3d 880, 898 n.25 (11th Cir. 2003) (â\\x80\\x9cBoth the legal\\n\\ntheory and the facts on which the federal claim rests must be substantially the same for it\\n\\nto be the substantial equivalent of the properly exhausted claim.â\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n       Procedural default will be excused only in two narrow circumstances. First, a\\n\\npetitioner may obtain federal review of a procedurally defaulted claim if he can show both\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccauseâ\\x80\\x9d for the default and actual â\\x80\\x9cprejudiceâ\\x80\\x9d resulting from the default. â\\x80\\x9cTo establish\\n\\nâ\\x80\\x98causeâ\\x80\\x99 for procedural default, a petitioner must demonstrate that some objective factor\\n\\n\\n                                             4\\n\\nexternal to the defense impeded the effort to raise the claim properly in the state court.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\nWright v. Hopper, 169 F.3d 695, 703 (11th Cir. 1999). To establish â\\x80\\x9cprejudice,â\\x80\\x9d a petitioner\\n\\nmust show that there is at least a reasonable probability that the result of the proceeding\\n\\nwould have been different.

Carrier, 477 U.S. 478, 496 (1986).\\n\\nActual innocence means factual innocence, not legal insufficiency. Bousley v. United States,\\n\\n523 U.S. 614, 623 (1998). To meet this standard, a petitioner must â\\x80\\x9cshow that it is more\\n\\nlikely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted himâ\\x80\\x9d of the underlying\\n\\noffense. Schlup v. Delo, 513 U.S. 298, 327 (1995). In addition, â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98[t]o be credible,â\\x80\\x99 a claim of\\n\\nactual innocence must be based on [new] reliable evidence not presented at trial.â\\x80\\x9d Calderon\\n\\nv.

Standard of Review Under the Antiterrorism Effective Death Penalty Act\\n              (â\\x80\\x9cAEDPAâ\\x80\\x9d)\\n\\n       Pursuant to the AEDPA, federal habeas relief may not be granted with respect to a\\n\\nclaim adjudicated on the merits in state court unless the adjudication of the claim:\\n\\n       (1)    resulted in a decision that was contrary to, or involved an\\n              unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as\\n              determined by the Supreme Court of the United States; or\\n\\n       (2)    resulted in a decision that was based on an unreasonable\\n              determination of the facts in light of the evidence presented in the\\n              State court proceeding.\\n\\n\\n\\n                                              5\\n\\n28 U.S.C.

Secretary for Depâ\\x80\\x99t. of Corr., 432\\n\\nF.3d 1292, 1308 (11th Cir. 2005). The meaning of the clauses was discussed by the Eleventh\\n\\nCircuit Court of Appeals in Parker v. Head, 244 F.3d 831, 835 (11th Cir. 2001):\\n\\n       Under the â\\x80\\x9ccontrary toâ\\x80\\x9d clause, a federal court may grant the writ if the state\\n       court arrives at a conclusion opposite to that reached by [the United States\\n       Supreme Court] on a question of law or if the state court decides a case\\n       differently than [the United States Supreme Court] has on a set of materially\\n       indistinguishable facts. Under the â\\x80\\x98unreasonable applicationâ\\x80\\x99 clause, a\\n       federal habeas court may grant the writ if the state court identifies the correct\\n       governing legal principle from [the United States Supreme Courtâ\\x80\\x99s] decisions\\n       but unreasonably applies that principle to the facts of the prisoner's case.\\n\\nEven if the federal court concludes that the state court applied federal law incorrectly,\\n\\nhabeas relief is appropriate only if that application was â\\x80\\x9cobjectively unreasonable.â\\x80\\x9d2 Id.\\n\\n       Finally, under Â§ 2254(d)(2), a federal court may grant a writ of habeas corpus if the\\n\\nstate courtâ\\x80\\x99s decision â\\x80\\x9cwas based on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\\n\\n\\n\\n        In considering the â\\x80\\x9cunreasonable applicationâ\\x80\\x9dinquiry, the Court must determine\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwhether the state court's application of clearly established federal law was objectively\\nunreasonable.â\\x80\\x9d Williams, 529 U.S. at 409. Whether a state court's decision was an\\nunreasonable application of law must be assessed in light of the record before the state\\ncourt. Holland v. Jackson, 542 U.S. 649, 652 (2004) (per curiam); cf. Bell v. Cone, 535 U.S. 685,\\n697 n. 4 (2002) (declining to consider evidence not presented to state court in determining\\nwhether its decision was contrary to federal law).\\n\\n                                               6\\n\\nthe evidence presented in the State court proceeding.â\\x80\\x9d A determination of a factual issue\\n\\nmade by a state court, however, shall be presumed correct, and the habeas petitioner shall\\n\\nhave the burden of rebutting the presumption of correctness by clear and convincing\\n\\nevidence. See Parker, 244 F.3d at 835-36; 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2254(e)(1).\\n\\n        III.   Analysis\\n\\n       Petitioner asserts that newly discovered evidence exculpates him of first degree\\n\\nmurder.    In support of his claim, Petitioner relies on the affidavits of Joel Rodriguez\\n\\n(â\\x80\\x9cRodriguezâ\\x80\\x9d) and Waldemar Viruet (â\\x80\\x9cViruetâ\\x80\\x9d), prison inmates. Specifically, Rodriguez\\n\\nattested on December 14, 2005, that while he was incarcerated at the Orange County Jail\\n\\nbetween July and September of 1998, Joel Sierra (â\\x80\\x9cSierraâ\\x80\\x9d) told him that (1) he saw\\n\\nPetitioner running away from the victim who was lying on the ground, (2) he saw the\\n\\nvictim try to get up, and (3) he (Sierra) shot the victim because he thought the victim might\\n\\nshoot Petitioner and the victim appeared to be suffering. See Doc. No. 1 at 23-25. According\\n\\nto Rodriguez, Sierra said that he knew Petitioner had been convicted for the murder. Id.\\n\\nat 25. Viruet attested on December 17, 2006, that he observed the events surrounding the\\n\\nmurder from across the street from the McDonaldâ\\x80\\x99s where the offense occurred. Id. at 27-\\n\\n28. According to Viruet, he recognized Petitioner as one of the guys involved in the fight,\\n\\nand although he could not hear what was said, Viruet saw the victim attack Petitioner, and\\n\\nas they started to fall to the ground, the gun went off. Id. at 27. Viruet attested that he saw\\n\\nPetitioner get to his feet and run away after which he observed another man approach the\\n\\nvictim, who was rolling around on the ground, and shoot the victim. Id. at 28.\\n\\n\\n                                              7\\n\\n       Respondents assert that Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s claim is procedurally barred from review\\n\\nbecause it was not raised as a federal claim in the state courts. The record demonstrates\\n\\nthat the instant claim was not raised as a federal constitutional claim in the state courts.\\n\\nPetitioner cited only to state cases in support of his claim, and all of his substantive\\n\\narguments addressed Florida law. Nothing in the claim, therefore, would have alerted the\\n\\nstate court to the presence of a federal claim. Thus, this claim was not exhausted and is\\n\\nprocedurally barred absent application of one of the exceptions.\\n\\n       In the present case, Petitioner has not shown either cause or prejudice that would\\n\\nexcuse the default. Likewise, Petitioner has not shown the applicability of the fundamental\\n\\nmiscarriage of justice exception. To the extent Petitioner relies on the affidavits of\\n\\nRodriguez and Viruet to establish the application of the fundamental miscarriage of justice\\n\\nexception, the Court concludes that this evidence is not reliable and Petitioner has not\\n\\ndemonstrated that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted\\n\\nhim given this evidence.\\n\\n       First, both Rodriguez and Viruet, who are inmates, provided Petitioner with\\n\\nstatements more than six years after Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s trial. Neither of them notified law\\n\\nenforcement at any point of what they saw on the night of the incident or heard regarding\\n\\nthe incident. Moreover, the statements contained in Rodriguezâ\\x80\\x99s affidavit that Sierra\\n\\nadmitted shooting the victim after Petitioner fled are hearsay statements. For these\\n\\nreasons, the Court cannot find that Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s newly discovered evidence is reliable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n                                             8\\n\\n       Moreover, even assuming that the newly discovered evidence were reliable, the\\n\\nevidence presented at trial refutes the application of the actual innocence exception. At\\n\\ntrial, Todd Wexler (â\\x80\\x9cWexlerâ\\x80\\x9d) testified that he saw Petitioner shoot the victim four times\\n\\nin rapid succession.3 (App. B at 339, 360, 365.) Wexler further testified that after Petitioner\\n\\nshot the victim and Petitioner and the others who were near the victim ran away, Wexler\\n\\nimmediately walked to the victim. Id. at 340, 359. Wexler stated that he heard two shots\\n\\nprior to Petitioner shooting the victim, but Wexler did not indicate that he heard or saw\\n\\nany shots fired after he saw Petitioner shoot the victim. Id. at 385, 387.\\n\\n       Bruno Goncalves (â\\x80\\x9cGoncalvesâ\\x80\\x9d) also testified that he saw Petitioner shoot the victim\\n\\nfour times in rapid succession. (App. B at 393, 402, 410-11.) Like Wexler, Goncalves\\n\\ntestified that he (Goncalves) went to the victim immediately after the victim was shot. Id.\\n\\nat 394. Goncalves testified that he heard one gunshot in the McDonaldâ\\x80\\x99s parking lot prior\\n\\nto the victim being shot, but Goncalves did not indicate that he saw or heard any shots\\n\\nfired after Petitioner shot the victim. Id. at 401.\\n\\n       Wexler and Goncalvesâ\\x80\\x99 testimony that they went to the victim after they saw\\n\\nPetitioner shoot the victim refutes the affidavits of Rodriguez and Viruet wherein they state\\n\\nthat another person shot the victim after Petitioner fled. In addition to Wexler and\\n\\nGoncalves testimony, Charles Lopez (â\\x80\\x9cLopezâ\\x80\\x9d) testified that he was with Petitioner at the\\n\\ntime of the incident and that Petitioner told him after they left the scene of the offense that\\n\\n\\n       Wexler testified that he did not identify Petitioner as the shooter on the date of the\\nincident but identified him a few days later after he had seen a news report on the incident\\nin which Petitioner was identified as a suspect.\\n\\n                                               9\\n\\nhe â\\x80\\x9cbucked that niggerâ\\x80\\x9d and made three hand motions in conjunction with the statement.\\n\\nId. at 433. Lopez stated that Petitioner told him that the victim said â\\x80\\x9cauâ\\x80\\x9d three times while\\n\\nPetitioner was shooting him. Id. at 435. Additionally, Detective Linnert testified that\\n\\nPetitioner admitted that he shot the victim in self defense three times while the victim was\\n\\non the ground and was kicking Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s legs. Finally, the evidence established that the\\n\\nbullet casings found around or in close proximity to the victim were from Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s 9\\n\\nmillimeter gun. For all of these reasons, the Court concludes that Petitioner has not\\n\\nestablished the applicability of the manifest miscarriage of justice exception to overcome\\n\\nthe procedural default bar, and this claim is procedurally barred.\\n\\n       Furthermore, the Court notes that a claim of actual innocence based on newly\\n\\ndiscovered evidence is not cognizable in habeas proceedings because federal habeas relief\\n\\nis designed to rectify constitutional violations, rather than factual errors. See Herrera v.\\n\\nCollins, 506 U.S. 390, 390-91 (1993) (â\\x80\\x9c[C]laims of actual innocence based on newly\\n\\ndiscovered evidence have never been held to state a ground for federal habeas relief absent\\n\\nan independent constitutional violation occurring in the course of the underlying state\\n\\ncriminal proceedings.â\\x80\\x9d); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963) (â\\x80\\x9c[T]he existence merely of\\n\\nnewly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of a state prisoner is not ground for relief\\n\\non federal habeas corpus.â\\x80\\x9d); Jordan v. Secretary, Dept. of Corrections, 485 F.3d 1351, 1356 (11th\\n\\nCir. 2007) (â\\x80\\x9cFor what it is worth, our precedent forbids granting habeas relief based upon\\n\\na claim of actual innocence, anyway, at least in non-capital cases.â\\x80\\x9d); Drake v. Francis, 727\\n\\nF.2d 990, 993 (11th Cir. 1984) (â\\x80\\x9cIn order for a claim of newly discovered evidence to justify\\n\\n\\n                                               10\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t   \\nhabeas review, the evidence must bear on the constitutionality of the defendantâ\\x80\\x99s\\n\\nconviction.â\\x80\\x9d). Petitioner did not assert in the state court that a constitutional violation\\n\\noccurred in the course of his trial. Petitioner summarily asserts in his memorandum in\\n\\nsupport of the instant habeas petition that his Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment rights â\\x80\\x9cto\\n\\na full and fair trial and/or postconviction review was denied by the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s failure to\\n\\nconsider the new evidence of innocence in state postconviction proceedings against the\\n\\nevidence of guilt by conducting an evidentiary hearing in the state postconviction\\n\\nproceedings.â\\x80\\x9d (Doc. No. 4 at 8.)      To the extent Petitioner has alleged a constitutional\\n\\nviolation occurred in the state postconviction proceeding, the Court notes that â\\x80\\x9c[a] habeas\\n\\npetition must allege that the petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s detention violates the constitution, a federal\\n\\nstatute, or a treaty. . . . [A] petition alleging errors in the state post-conviction review\\n\\nprocess is not addressable through habeas corpus proceedings.â\\x80\\x9d Franzen v. Brinkman, 877\\n\\nF.2d 26 (9th Cir. 1989).\\n\\n       In Spradley v. Dugger, 825 F.2d 1566 (11th Cir. 1987), the petitioner argued that the\\n\\nstate trial court violated his due process rights when it denied his Rule 3.850 motion\\n\\nbecause it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing and because its opinion denying relief\\n\\nfailed to attach those portions of the record on which it relied. The Eleventh Circuit Court\\n\\nof Appeals held that the state trial courtâ\\x80\\x99s alleged errors in the Rule 3.850 proceedings did\\n\\nnot undermine the validity of the petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s conviction; therefore, the claim went to issues\\n\\nunrelated to the cause of the petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s detention, and it did not state a basis for habeas\\n\\nrelief. Id. at 1567; see also Mitchell v. Wyrick, 727 F.2d 773, 774 (8th Cir. 1984) ( â\\x80\\x9cEven where\\n\\n\\n                                               11\\n\\nthere may be some error in state post-conviction proceedings, this would not entitle\\n\\nappellant to federal habeas corpus relief since appellantâ\\x80\\x99s claim here represents an attack\\n\\non a proceeding collateral to detention of appellant and not on the detention itself.â\\x80\\x9d)\\n\\n(quotation omitted) (citation omitted). Petitioner alleges error in the state post-conviction\\n\\nreview process which is not addressable through the instant habeas corpus proceeding.\\n\\nThus, even if the claim were not procedurally barred, it is not cognizable.\\n\\n       Finally, even assuming that this claim was not procedurally barred and was\\n\\ncognizable, the claim would be subject to denial pursuant to Â§ 2254(d). The state trial court\\n\\ndenied relief on Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s claim of newly discovered evidence. (App. E at 85-88.) In so\\n\\nruling, the state court reasoned that Rodriguezâ\\x80\\x99s testimony would not have made a\\n\\ndifference in the outcome of the trial because:\\n\\n              the medical examiner could not determine the caliber of the\\n              bullet that caused the victimâ\\x80\\x99s fatal wound to the heart, but he\\n              never indicated that he could determine the caliber of any\\n              other bullet that struck the victim. Furthermore, Rodriguez\\n              does not mention the caliber of the bullet or even the type of\\n              gun Sierra said he used. Finally, while spent casings matching\\n              Defendantâ\\x80\\x99s 9mm pistol were found near the victimâ\\x80\\x99s body, the\\n              .45 caliber casing was found in a different area. . . .\\n\\n                    Furthermore, Defendant cannot establish that\\n              Rodriguezâ\\x80\\x99s hearsay testimony regarding Sierraâ\\x80\\x99s purported\\n              confession would even be admissible. . . .\\n\\n                      Finally, the victim received another bullet wound that\\n              would have probably been fatal, i.e., a bullet pierced his right\\n              lung and caused internal bleeding into the chest cavity. Even\\n              if Defendant could offer conclusive proof that there was a\\n              second shooter and that he himself did not fire the fatal shot,\\n              he still could have been convicted of first degree murder as a\\n              principal. . . .\\n\\n                                             12\\n\\nId. at 86-87 (citations omitted). As to Viruetâ\\x80\\x99s testimony, the state court reasoned:\\n\\n\\t               [although] Viruetâ\\x80\\x99s testimony would presumably corroborate\\n               Sierraâ\\x80\\x99s confession . . . it would not change the fact that\\n               Defendant could still have been convicted of first-degree\\n               murder as a principal. Furthermore, there is no reasonable\\n               probability that it would support a self-defense theory. It\\n               would be inconsistent with Defendantâ\\x80\\x99s own statement that the\\n               victim was lying on his back on the pavement when Defendant\\n               fired three shots at him. It would also be inconsistent with the\\n               testimony of eyewitnesses Joseph Wexler and Bruno\\n               Goncalves, who asserted that Defendant walked over and shot\\n               the victim after others who had been fighting with him had\\n               caused him to end up on the ground.\\n\\nId. at 88 (citations omitted).\\n\\n       Upon review of the record, the Court concludes that Petitioner has failed to\\n\\ndemonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s determination is\\n\\nunreasonable in light of the evidence presented.            Moreover, Petitioner has not\\n\\ndemonstrated that the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s determination is either contrary to, or an unreasonable\\n\\napplication of, federal law. Accordingly, this claim is subject to denial pursuant to Â§\\n\\n2254(d).\\n\\n       Any of Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s allegations not specifically addressed herein have been found to\\n\\nbe without merit.\\n\\n       Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED AND ADJUDGED:\\n\\n       1.      The Petition for Writ of Habeas Corpus (Doc. No. 1) filed by Fabio Nieves is\\n\\nDENIED, and this case is DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE.\\n\\n       2.      The Clerk of the Court shall enter judgment accordingly and is directed to\\n\\nclose this case.\\n\\n                                             13\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t \\n      DONE AND ORDERED at Orlando, Florida, this 20th day of August, 2009.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCopies to:\\nsc 8/20\\nFabio Nieves\\nCounsel of Record\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\""
