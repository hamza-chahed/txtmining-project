Analysis\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t       Petitioner asserts that newly discovered evidence exculpates him of first degree\\n\\nmurder.    In support of his claim, Petitioner relies on the affidavits of Joel Rodriguez\\n\\n(â\\x80\\x9cRodriguezâ\\x80\\x9d) and Waldemar Viruet (â\\x80\\x9cViruetâ\\x80\\x9d), prison inmates. Specifically, Rodriguez\\n\\nattested on December 14, 2005, that while he was incarcerated at the Orange County Jail\\n\\nbetween July and September of 1998, Joel Sierra (â\\x80\\x9cSierraâ\\x80\\x9d) told him that (1) he saw\\n\\nPetitioner running away from the victim who was lying on the ground, (2) he saw the\\n\\nvictim try to get up, and (3) he (Sierra) shot the victim because he thought the victim might\\n\\nshoot Petitioner and the victim appeared to be suffering. See Doc. No. 1 at 23-25. According\\n\\nto Rodriguez, Sierra said that he knew Petitioner had been convicted for the murder. Id.\\n\\nat 25. Viruet attested on December 17, 2006, that he observed the events surrounding the\\n\\nmurder from across the street from the McDonaldâ\\x80\\x99s where the offense occurred. Id. at 27-\\n\\n28. According to Viruet, he recognized Petitioner as one of the guys involved in the fight,\\n\\nand although he could not hear what was said, Viruet saw the victim attack Petitioner, and\\n\\nas they started to fall to the ground, the gun went off. Id. at 27.

The record demonstrates\\n\\nthat the instant claim was not raised as a federal constitutional claim in the state courts.\\n\\nPetitioner cited only to state cases in support of his claim, and all of his substantive\\n\\narguments addressed Florida law. Nothing in the claim, therefore, would have alerted the\\n\\nstate court to the presence of a federal claim. Thus, this claim was not exhausted and is\\n\\nprocedurally barred absent application of one of the exceptions.\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t       In the present case, Petitioner has not shown either cause or prejudice that would\\n\\nexcuse the default. Likewise, Petitioner has not shown the applicability of the fundamental\\n\\nmiscarriage of justice exception. To the extent Petitioner relies on the affidavits of\\n\\nRodriguez and Viruet to establish the application of the fundamental miscarriage of justice\\n\\nexception, the Court concludes that this evidence is not reliable and Petitioner has not\\n\\ndemonstrated that it is more likely than not that no reasonable juror would have convicted\\n\\nhim given this evidence.\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t       First, both Rodriguez and Viruet, who are inmates, provided Petitioner with\\n\\nstatements more than six years after Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s trial. Neither of them notified law\\n\\nenforcement at any point of what they saw on the night of the incident or heard regarding\\n\\nthe incident. Moreover, the statements contained in Rodriguezâ\\x80\\x99s affidavit that Sierra\\n\\nadmitted shooting the victim after Petitioner fled are hearsay statements. For these\\n\\nreasons, the Court cannot find that Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s newly discovered evidence is reliable.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t                                             8\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t       Moreover, even assuming that the newly discovered evidence were reliable, the\\n\\nevidence presented at trial refutes the application of the actual innocence exception. At\\n\\ntrial, Todd Wexler (â\\x80\\x9cWexlerâ\\x80\\x9d) testified that he saw Petitioner shoot the victim four times\\n\\nin rapid succession.3 (App. B at 339, 360, 365.) Wexler further testified that after Petitioner\\n\\nshot the victim and Petitioner and the others who were near the victim ran away, Wexler\\n\\nimmediately walked to the victim. Id. at 340, 359. Wexler stated that he heard two shots\\n\\nprior to Petitioner shooting the victim, but Wexler did not indicate that he heard or saw\\n\\nany shots fired after he saw Petitioner shoot the victim. Id. at 385, 387.\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t       Bruno Goncalves (â\\x80\\x9cGoncalvesâ\\x80\\x9d) also testified that he saw Petitioner shoot the victim\\n\\nfour times in rapid succession. (App. B at 393, 402, 410-11.) Like Wexler, Goncalves\\n\\ntestified that he (Goncalves) went to the victim immediately after the victim was shot. Id.\\n\\nat 394. Goncalves testified that he heard one gunshot in the McDonaldâ\\x80\\x99s parking lot prior\\n\\nto the victim being shot, but Goncalves did not indicate that he saw or heard any shots\\n\\nfired after Petitioner shot the victim. Id. at 401.\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t       Wexler and Goncalvesâ\\x80\\x99 testimony that they went to the victim after they saw\\n\\nPetitioner shoot the victim refutes the affidavits of Rodriguez and Viruet wherein they state\\n\\nthat another person shot the victim after Petitioner fled. In addition to Wexler and\\n\\nGoncalves testimony, Charles Lopez (â\\x80\\x9cLopezâ\\x80\\x9d) testified that he was with Petitioner at the\\n\\ntime of the incident and that Petitioner told him after they left the scene of the offense that\\n\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t       Wexler testified that he did not identify Petitioner as the shooter on the date of the\\nincident but identified him a few days later after he had seen a news report on the incident\\nin which Petitioner was identified as a suspect.\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t                                               9\\n\\nhe â\\x80\\x9cbucked that niggerâ\\x80\\x9d and made three hand motions in conjunction with the statement.\\n\\nId. at 433. Lopez stated that Petitioner told him that the victim said â\\x80\\x9cauâ\\x80\\x9d three times while\\n\\nPetitioner was shooting him. Id. at 435. Additionally, Detective Linnert testified that\\n\\nPetitioner admitted that he shot the victim in self defense three times while the victim was\\n\\non the ground and was kicking Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s legs. Finally, the evidence established that the\\n\\nbullet casings found around or in close proximity to the victim were from Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s 9\\n\\nmillimeter gun. For all of these reasons, the Court concludes that Petitioner has not\\n\\nestablished the applicability of the manifest miscarriage of justice exception to overcome\\n\\nthe procedural default bar, and this claim is procedurally barred.\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t       Furthermore, the Court notes that a claim of actual innocence based on newly\\n\\ndiscovered evidence is not cognizable in habeas proceedings because federal habeas relief\\n\\nis designed to rectify constitutional violations, rather than factual errors. See Herrera v.\\n\\nCollins, 506 U.S. 390, 390-91 (1993) (â\\x80\\x9c[C]laims of actual innocence based on newly\\n\\ndiscovered evidence have never been held to state a ground for federal habeas relief absent\\n\\nan independent constitutional violation occurring in the course of the underlying state\\n\\ncriminal proceedings.â\\x80\\x9d); Townsend v. Sain, 372 U.S. 293 (1963) (â\\x80\\x9c[T]he existence merely of\\n\\nnewly discovered evidence relevant to the guilt of a state prisoner is not ground for relief\\n\\non federal habeas corpus.â\\x80\\x9d); Jordan v.

No. 4 at 8.)      To the extent Petitioner has alleged a constitutional\\n\\nviolation occurred in the state postconviction proceeding, the Court notes that â\\x80\\x9c[a] habeas\\n\\npetition must allege that the petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s detention violates the constitution, a federal\\n\\nstatute, or a treaty. . . . [A] petition alleging errors in the state post-conviction review\\n\\nprocess is not addressable through habeas corpus proceedings.â\\x80\\x9d Franzen v.

Dugger, 825 F.2d 1566 (11th Cir. 1987), the petitioner argued that the\\n\\nstate trial court violated his due process rights when it denied his Rule 3.850 motion\\n\\nbecause it did not conduct an evidentiary hearing and because its opinion denying relief\\n\\nfailed to attach those portions of the record on which it relied. The Eleventh Circuit Court\\n\\nof Appeals held that the state trial courtâ\\x80\\x99s alleged errors in the Rule 3.850 proceedings did\\n\\nnot undermine the validity of the petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s conviction; therefore, the claim went to issues\\n\\nunrelated to the cause of the petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s detention, and it did not state a basis for habeas\\n\\nrelief.

The state trial court\\n\\ndenied relief on Petitionerâ\\x80\\x99s claim of newly discovered evidence. (App. E at 85-88.) In so\\n\\nruling, the state court reasoned that Rodriguezâ\\x80\\x99s testimony would not have made a\\n\\ndifference in the outcome of the trial because:\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t              the medical examiner could not determine the caliber of the\\n              bullet that caused the victimâ\\x80\\x99s fatal wound to the heart, but he\\n              never indicated that he could determine the caliber of any\\n              other bullet that struck the victim.

Finally, while spent casings matching\\n              Defendantâ\\x80\\x99s 9mm pistol were found near the victimâ\\x80\\x99s body, the\\n              .45 caliber casing was found in a different area. . . .\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t                    Furthermore, Defendant cannot establish that\\n              Rodriguezâ\\x80\\x99s hearsay testimony regarding Sierraâ\\x80\\x99s purported\\n              confession would even be admissible. . . .\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t                      Finally, the victim received another bullet wound that\\n              would have probably been fatal, i.e., a bullet pierced his right\\n              lung and caused internal bleeding into the chest cavity. Even\\n              if Defendant could offer conclusive proof that there was a\\n              second shooter and that he himself did not fire the fatal shot,\\n              he still could have been convicted of first degree murder as a\\n              principal. . . .\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t                                             12\\n\\nId. at 86-87 (citations omitted). As to Viruetâ\\x80\\x99s testimony, the state court reasoned:\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t               [although] Viruetâ\\x80\\x99s testimony would presumably corroborate\\n               Sierraâ\\x80\\x99s confession . . . it would not change the fact that\\n               Defendant could still have been convicted of first-degree\\n               murder as a principal. Furthermore, there is no reasonable\\n               probability that it would support a self-defense theory. It\\n               would be inconsistent with Defendantâ\\x80\\x99s own statement that the\\n               victim was lying on his back on the pavement when Defendant\\n               fired three shots at him. It would also be inconsistent with the\\n               testimony of eyewitnesses Joseph Wexler and Bruno\\n               Goncalves, who asserted that Defendant walked over and shot\\n               the victim after others who had been fighting with him had\\n               caused him to end up on the ground.\\n\\nId. at 88 (citations omitted).\\n\\nFALSE\\tNONE\\t       Upon review of the record, the Court concludes that Petitioner has failed to\\n\\ndemonstrate by clear and convincing evidence that the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s determination is\\n\\nunreasonable in light of the evidence presented.            Moreover, Petitioner has not\\n\\ndemonstrated that the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s determination is either contrary to, or an unreasonable\\n\\napplication of, federal law.
