Introduction and Background.\\n\\n        Before the Court are defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 motion to dismiss a complaint which they removed from\\nthe Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County to this Court on May 16, 2008, and plaintiffsâ\\x80\\x99\\nmotion to remand to that Court for lack of federal jurisdiction. After careful consideration of the\\ncomplaint, the notice of removal, the pending motions, and the briefs in support and in\\nopposition thereto, the Court will grant plaintiffsâ\\x80\\x99 motion to remand to state court, and will deny\\ndefendantsâ\\x80\\x99 motion to dismiss without prejudice to raise the issues set forth therein in the Court\\nof Common Pleas of Allegheny County, including any federal preemption defense they may\\nhave.\\n\\nTrue\\tCOMPLAINT\\tA. State Court Complaint.\\n\\n        Plaintiffs Salsgiver Communications, Inc., Salsgiver Telecom, Inc., and Salsgiver, Inc.\\nfiled their Complaint in Civil Action in state court setting forth three causes of action, each\\nsounding in Pennsylvania common law tort, namely, negligent and intentional interference with\\nprospective and existing contractual relations with third parties. Count I alleges that Salsgiver\\nCommunications, Inc. is and was at all relevant times a â\\x80\\x9ccable television systemâ\\x80\\x9d within the\\nmeaning of the Pole Attachment Act (the Actâ\\x80\\x9d), 47 U.S.C. Â§ 224 (a provision of the Federal\\nCommunications Act of 1934, as amended); that defendants Consolidated Communications\\nHoldings, Inc., North Pittsburgh Systems, Inc., and North Pittsburgh Telephone Company, Inc.\\nwere required by the Act to allow cable television systems, including Salsgiver Communications\\naccess to defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 poles, as the Federal Communications Commission held and ordered\\nfollowing its adjudication of Salsgiver Communicationsâ\\x80\\x99 administrative complaint; that\\ndefendants knew or should have known since October 2004 that Salsgiver Communications was\\nentitled to use defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 poles; and that defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 refusal to allow access to said poles\\nwillfully, intentionally, purposefully and negligently interfered with Salsgiver Communicationsâ\\x80\\x99\\nprospective and existing contractual relations with third parties, causing over one hundred\\nmillion dollars in lost profits and other damages when Salsgiver Communications was unable to\\nfulfill its obligations to third parties. Complaint, Â¶Â¶ 1-23. Count II alleges that Salsgiver\\nTelecom, Inc. is and was a â\\x80\\x9ctelecommunications carrierâ\\x80\\x9d within the meaning of the Act at all\\nrelevant times and, as such, was also entitled to access to defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 poles, as the FCC held and\\nordered following its adjudication of Salsgiver Telecomâ\\x80\\x99s administrative complaint; that\\ndefendants knew or should have known since October 2005 that Salsgiver Telecom was entitled\\nto use defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 poles; and that defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 refusal to allow access to said poles willfully,\\nintentionally, purposefully and negligently interfered with Salsgiver Telecomâ\\x80\\x99s contractual\\nrelations with third parties, causing the loss of over $1.6 million in lost profit and other damages\\nwhen Salsgiver Telecom was unable to fulfill its obligations to third parties. Complaint, Â¶Â¶ 24-\\n30. Count III alleges that defendants willfully, intentionally, purposefully and negligently\\ninterfered with Salsgiver Inc.â\\x80\\x99s contractual relations with its wholly-owned subsidiaries, the other\\nSalsgiver entities, causing over $3.2 million in unnecessary costs and expenditures and other\\ndamages. Complaint, Â¶Â¶ 31-35.\\n\\nTrue\\tNOTICE\\tB.Notice of Removal.\\n\\n       Defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 Notice of Removal claims federal question jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331, as\\nthe basis for removal under 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1441, stating â\\x80\\x9ctwo independent basesâ\\x80\\x9d for federal\\nquestion jurisdiction. First, defendants assert that the complaint raises a â\\x80\\x9csubstantial federal\\nquestion,â\\x80\\x9d and therefore arises under federal law, because a necessary element of plaintiffsâ\\x80\\x99 cause\\nof action for intentional interference with existing and prospective contractual relations is that\\ndefendants had no privilege or justification for their alleged acts of interference, that whatever\\nduties defendants have to provide access to plaintiffs to use its poles is established by the Act,\\nand that the alleged violation of the Act and lack of privilege or justification â\\x80\\x9care central and\\nessential elements of Plaintiffsâ\\x80\\x99 purported causes of action.â\\x80\\x9d Notice of Removal (doc. no. 1) at\\nÂ¶Â¶ 10-13. Second, defendants claim that the Act completely preempts any state regulations or\\nlaws implicating pole attachments under the Act. Id. at Â¶Â¶ 14-17.\\n\\nTrue\\tMOTION\\tC. Motion to Remand.\\n\\n       Plaintiffs contend that this Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction because their claims of\\ninterference with prospective and existing contractual relations under Pennsylvania common law\\ndo not present a substantial federal question. Whatever federal question may have existed has\\nbeen finally adjudicated by the decisions of the FCC1 holding that Salsgiver Communications,\\nInc. qualifies as a â\\x80\\x9ccable television systemâ\\x80\\x9d and that Salsgiver Telecom, Inc. is a\\nâ\\x80\\x9ctelecommunications carrierâ\\x80\\x9d within the meaning of the Act, and therefore, both are and were\\nentitled to non-discriminatory access to defendantsâ\\x80\\x99 utility poles.Defendants respond that a substantial federal dispute remains an essential element of plaintiffsâ\\x80\\x99 claims, that the Act completely preempts state regulatory authority over pole\\nattachments, and that plaintiffsâ\\x80\\x99 claims must be recharacterized as federal claims under the\\nFederal Communications Act of which the Pole Attachment Act is a part.\\n\\nTrue\\tJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\\tII. Removal Jurisdiction.\\n\\nTrue\\tPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\\tA. In General.\\n\\n       Removal is governed by statute, 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1441, which provides: â\\x80\\x9c(a) Except as\\notherwise expressly provided by Act of Congress, any civil action brought in a State court of\\nwhich the district courts of the United States have original jurisdiction, may be removed by the\\ndefendant or the defendants, to the district court of the United States for the district and division\\nembracing the place where such action is pending.â\\x80\\x9d Federal district courts have â\\x80\\x9cfederal\\nquestionâ\\x80\\x9d jurisdiction over â\\x80\\x9call civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the\\nUnited States,â\\x80\\x9d 28 U.S.C. Â§ 1331, and diversity jurisdiction over citizens of different states, 28\\nU.S.C. Â§ 1332. Where, as here, â\\x80\\x9cthe parties are not diverse, removal is appropriate only if the\\ncase falls within the district court\\'s original â\\x80\\x98federal questionâ\\x80\\x99 jurisdiction.â\\x80\\x9d U.S. Express Lines\\nLtd. v. Higgins, 281 F.3d 383, 389 (3d Cir. 2002).\\n\\n         The FCC Adjudications of May 23, 2007 and November 26, 2007, are attached to\\ndefendantsâ\\x80\\x99 Motion to Dismiss Complaint Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P 12(b)(6) as Exhibits B and C,\\nrespectively (doc. no. 4-4 and 4-5).\\n\\n        Whether filed initially in federal court or on removal from a state court, a federal court\\nmust always consider its own jurisdiction to proceed in a matter, and should do so sua sponte if\\nnot raised by the parties. Id. at 388-89 (recognizing the â\\x80\\x9cduty of federal courts to examine their\\nsubject matter jurisdiction at all stages of the litigation sua sponte if the parties fail to raise the\\nissue.â\\x80\\x9d). As federal courts are courts of only limited jurisdiction, there is a general presumption\\nagainst federal jurisdiction which the party seeking to invoke federal jurisdiction bears the\\nburden of rebutting. Kokkonen v. Guardian Life Ins. Co. of Am., 511 U.S. 375, 377 (1994).\\nThus, â\\x80\\x9cstatutes purporting to confer federal jurisdiction are to be consTrued narrowly, with\\nambiguities resolved against a finding of federal jurisdiction,â\\x80\\x9d given the â\\x80\\x9cwell-established\\nprinciples reflecting a reluctance to find federal jurisdiction unless it is clearly provided . . .â\\x80\\x9d by\\nCongress. ErieNet, Inc. v. Velocity Net, Inc., 156 F.3d 513, 518 (3d Cir. 1998) (citations\\nomitted) (Telephone Consumer Protection Act did not provide for private suits in federal court;\\nâ\\x80\\x9cappellants\\' argument that federal question jurisdiction is proper because the complaint poses a\\nsubstantial federal question seems misplaced [here because] federal law is the source of\\nappellants\\' cause of action, but refers litigants to state courts only. Thus, regardless of the\\npresence of a substantial federal question, Congress\\' intent to preclude consumer suits under\\nTCPA in federal court trumps the general grant of federal question jurisdiction in Â§ 1331.â\\x80\\x9d).\\n\\n        So too, because federal courts have limited jurisdiction as defined by Congress, the\\nremoval statutes are strictly consTrued against removal. E.g., American Fire & Cas. Co. v. Finn,\\n341 U.S. 6 (1951); Batoff v. State Farm Ins. Co., 977 F.2d 848, 851 (3d Cir. 1974). The United\\nStates Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit has repeatedly emphasized that because the party\\nâ\\x80\\x9cwho urges jurisdiction on a federal court bears the burden of proving that jurisdiction exists . . . ,\\nall doubts should be resolved in favor of remand.â\\x80\\x9d Boyer v. Snap-on Tools Corp., 913 F.2d 108,\\n111 (3d Cir. 1990) (internal quotations and citations omitted). See also Morgan v. Gay, 471 F.3d\\n469, 472 (3d Cir. 2006) (â\\x80\\x9cThe party seeking to remove a case to federal court bears the burden to\\nestablish jurisdiction.â\\x80\\x9d), citing Boyer and Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 561\\n(1992) ( â\\x80\\x9cThe party invoking federal jurisdiction bears the burden of establishing these\\nelements.â\\x80\\x9d ); Brown v. Francis, 75 F.3d 860, 865 (3d Cir. 1996) (â\\x80\\x9call doubtsâ\\x80\\x9d means that if\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthere is any doubt as to the propriety of removal, [the] case should not be removed to federal\\ncourtâ\\x80\\x9d and should be remanded).\\n\\nTrue\\tREMOVAL\\tB.Federal Question Removal.\\n\\n         Whether or not the Court has federal question jurisdiction over a matter that the\\ndefendant has removed from state court is governed by the â\\x80\\x9cwell-pleaded complaint rule,â\\x80\\x9d under\\nwhich the federal question â\\x80\\x9cmust be disclosed upon the face of the complaint, unaided by the\\nanswer or by the petition for removal.â\\x80\\x9d Id. (citation omitted). Metropolitan Life Ins. Co. v.\\nPrice, 501 F.3d 271, 276 (3d Cir. 2007) (â\\x80\\x9cFederal question jurisdiction exists when the\\nplaintiff\\'s well-pleaded complaint establishes that â\\x80\\x98federal law creates the cause of action.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d).\\nThe well-pleaded complaint rule â\\x80\\x9cmakes the plaintiff the master of the claim; he or she may\\navoid federal jurisdiction by exclusive reliance on state law.â\\x80\\x9d Kline v. Security Guards, Inc., 386\\nF.3d 246, 252 (3d Cir. 2004), citing Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987);\\nKrashna v. Oliver Realty, Inc., 895 F.2d 111, 113 (3d Cir. 1990) .\\n\\n       The Court of Appeals summarized the well-pleaded complaint rule in In re Community\\nBank of Northern Virginia, 418 F.3d 277, 293-94 (3d Cir. 2005) as follows:\\n       It is well settled that â\\x80\\x9c[o]nly state-court actions that originally could have been\\n        filed in federal court may be removed to federal court by the defendant.â\\x80\\x9d\\n        Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams, 482 U.S. 386, 392 (1987). Under the well-pleaded\\n        complaint rule, there can be no removal on the basis of a federal question unless\\n        the federal law under which the claim arises is a direct and essential element of\\n        the plaintiffâ\\x80\\x99s case. See Franchise Tax Bd. of Cal. v. Constr. Laborers Vacation\\n        Trust for S. Cal., 463 U.S. 1, 10-12 (1983); Louisville & Nashville R.R. Co. v.\\n        Mottley, 211 U.S. 149 (1908).\\n\\nTrue\\tJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\\tC. â\\x80\\x9cArising Underâ\\x80\\x9d Jurisdiction.\\n\\n        Generally, a case â\\x80\\x9caris[es] under federal lawâ\\x80\\x9d for section 1331 purposes if â\\x80\\x9ca\\nwell-pleaded complaint establishes either that federal law creates the cause of action or that the\\nplaintiff\\'s right to relief necessarily depends on resolution of a substantial question of federal\\nlaw.â\\x80\\x9d Empire Healthchoice Assurance, Inc. v. McVeigh, 547 U.S. 677, 689-90 (2006) (citing\\nFranchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at 27-28. â\\x80\\x9cArising underâ\\x80\\x9d jurisdiction may not always be easy to\\ndiscern, as the Court of Appeals explained in the ErieNet case:\\n        The term \"arising under\" eludes precise definition. Justice Holmes articulated the\\n        most common definition: \"[a] suit arises under the law that creates the cause of\\n        action.\" American Well Works Co. v. Layne & Bowler Co., 241 U.S. 257, 260\\n        (1916). More recently, this court has recognized two tests that generally apply to\\n        a court\\'s assessment of federal question jurisdiction. See Virgin Islands Housing\\n        Auth. v. Coastal General Constr. Serv. Corp., 27 F.3d 911, 916 (3d Cir. 1994).\\n        \"First, the question is whether federal law creates the cause of action. If not, the\\n        second inquiry is whether the complaint poses a substantial federal question.\" Id.\\n        (citing West 14th Street Commercial Corp. v. 5 West 14th Owners Corp., 815 F.2d\\n        188, 192 (2d Cir. 1987)). See also Franchise Tax Board v. Construction Laborers\\n        Vacation Trust, 463 U.S. 1, 27-28 (1983).\\n156 F.3d at 518 (parallel citations omitted).\\n\\n        â\\x80\\x9cArising underâ\\x80\\x9d federal question jurisdiction became less elusive, however, in Grable &\\nSons Metal Products, Inc. v. Darue Engineering & Mfg., 545 U.S. 308 (2005), which\\nsubstantially clarified and confined its meaning. In the Grable & Sons case, the United States\\nSupreme Court recognized that the â\\x80\\x9carising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United\\nStatesâ\\x80\\x9d provision for federal-question jurisdiction is most often invoked by plaintiffs pleading a\\ncause of action expressly created by federal law, such as claims under 42 U.S.C. Â§1983, but\\nnarrowed the reach of the â\\x80\\x9csubstantial federal questionâ\\x80\\x9d type of â\\x80\\x9carising underâ\\x80\\x9d jurisdiction as\\nfollows:\\n        There is . . . another longstanding, if less frequently encountered, variety of\\n        federal â\\x80\\x9carising underâ\\x80\\x9d jurisdiction, this Court having recognized for nearly 100\\n        years that in certain cases federal-question jurisdiction will lie over state-law\\n        claims that implicate significant federal issues. E.g., Hopkins v. Walker, 244 U.S.\\n        486, 490-491(1917). The doctrine captures the commonsense notion that a federal\\n        court ought to be able to hear claims recognized under state law that nonetheless\\n        turn on substantial questions of federal law, and thus justify resort to the\\n        experience, solicitude, and hope of uniformity that a federal forum offers on\\n        federal issues, see ALI, Study of the Division of Jurisdiction Between State and\\n        Federal Courts 164-166 (1968).\\n545 U.S. at 312 (parallel citations omitted).\\n\\n        But, the Court further explained, â\\x80\\x9carising underâ\\x80\\x9d jurisdiction does not take an â\\x80\\x9cexpansive\\nview that mere need to apply federal law in a state-law claim will suffice to open the â\\x80\\x98arising\\nunderâ\\x80\\x99 door . . . ,â\\x80\\x9d and noted that early-on, the Court had â\\x80\\x9cconfined federal-question jurisdiction\\nover state-law claims to those that â\\x80\\x98really and substantially involv[e] a dispute or controversy\\nrespecting the validity, construction or effect of [federal] law. . . .â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 313 (citations\\nomitted). See also Empire Healthchoice, 547 U.S. at 700-01 (not every case that implicates a\\nfederal law or statute, such as the Federal Employees Health Benefits Act, is a â\\x80\\x9cfederal caseâ\\x80\\x9d; â\\x80\\x9cIn\\nsum, Grable emphasized that it takes more than a federal element â\\x80\\x98to open the â\\x80\\x98arising underâ\\x80\\x99\\ndoor.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d); Merrell Dow Pharm. Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U.S. 804, 813 (1986) (\"the mere presence\\nof a federal issue in a state cause of action does not automatically confer federal-question\\njurisdiction.\"). The Court stated that there is no â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98single, precise, all-embracingâ\\x80\\x99 test for\\njurisdiction over federal issues embedded in state-law claims between nondiverse parties,â\\x80\\x9d and,\\nin an oft-quoted phrase of limitation, stated:\\n        We have not kept [federal issues embedded in state-law claims] out simply\\n        because they appeared in state raiment, as Justice Holmes would have done . . . ,\\n        but neither have we treated â\\x80\\x9cfederal issueâ\\x80\\x9d as a password opening federal courts to\\n        any state action embracing a point of federal law. Instead, the question is, does a\\n        state-law claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and\\n        substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any\\n        congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.\\nGrable & Sons 545 U.S. at 314 (citation omitted; emphasis added).\\n\\nTrue\\tPREEMPTION\\tD. â\\x80\\x9cArtful Pleadingâ\\x80\\x9d Exception - Complete Preemption.\\n\\n        As the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit stated in the Kline case, there\\nis an â\\x80\\x9cexception to the well-pleaded complaint rule that precludes a plaintiff from â\\x80\\x98avoid[ing] a\\nfederal forum by â\\x80\\x98artfully pleadingâ\\x80\\x99 what is, in essence, a federal claim solely in terms of state\\nlaw.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d 386 F.3d at 252, citing Caterpillar, 482 U.S. at 393 (additional citations omitted). See\\nalso United Jersey Banks v. Parell, 783 F.2d 360, 367 (3d Cir.1986), cert. denied, 476 U.S. 1170\\n(1986) (a plaintiff cannot avoid federal jurisdiction by â\\x80\\x9cartfully pleadingâ\\x80\\x9d his federal claim as a\\nstate law claim). In Franchise Tax Bd., 463 U.S. at 13, the Supreme Court identified two\\nsituations where federal jurisdiction could be available even though plaintiffâ\\x80\\x99s claim in state\\ncourt is based on state law: (1) when â\\x80\\x9cit appears that some substantial, disputed question of\\nfederal law is a necessary element of one of the well-pleaded state claimsâ\\x80\\x9d or (2) when it appears\\nthat plaintiff\\'s claim â\\x80\\x9cis â\\x80\\x98reallyâ\\x80\\x99 one of federal law.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n        The first situation seems less an exception to the well-pleaded complaint rule than an\\napplication of the principles of determining if â\\x80\\x9carising underâ\\x80\\x9d federal question jurisdiction exists.\\nThe second situation where a state claim may be deemed to be â\\x80\\x9creallyâ\\x80\\x9d one of federal law, is\\ndependent upon whether Congress has completely preempted state laws and regulations, and has\\nbeen equated with the â\\x80\\x9ccomplete preemptionâ\\x80\\x9d doctrine. Complete preemption is \"a distinct\\nconcept from ordinary preemption\" and \"the fact that a defendant might ultimately prove that a\\nplaintiff\\'s claims are pre-empted . . . does not establish that they are removable to federal court.\"\\nGoepel v. National Postal Mail Handlers Union, a Div. of LIUNA, 36 F.3d 306, 310 (3d Cir.\\n1994), quoting Railway Labor Excecutives Ass\\'n v. Pittsburgh & Lake Erie R.

In Caterpillar, the\\n       Supreme Court stated:\\n               On occasion, the Court has concluded that the preemptive force of a\\n               statute is so extraordinary that it converts an ordinary state common-law\\n               complaint into one stating a federal claim for purposes of the well-pleaded\\n               complaint rule. . . . Once an area of state law has been completely\\n               pre-empted, any claim purportedly based on that pre-empted state law is\\n               considered, from its inception, a federal claim, and therefore arises under\\n               federal law.\\n       Id.

If a court holds a witness in contempt for invoking his or her right\\nagainst self-incrimination, when that witness has not been granted immunity that is\\ncoextensive with the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, the order of\\ncontempt must be reversed and the sanction imposed must be vacated.\\n\\n        Review of the judgment of the Court of Appeals in 52 Kan.

Opinion filed March 2, 2018.\\nJudgment of the Court of Appeals affirming the district court is reversed. Judgment of the district court is\\nreversed, and sentence is vacated.\\n\\n        Sam S. Kepfield, of Hutchinson, argued the cause and was on the brief for appellant.\\n        Keith E. Schroeder, district attorney, argued the cause, and Derek Schmidt, attorney general, was\\nwith him on the brief for appellee.PER CURIAM: Jose Delacruz seeks review of the Court of Appeals\\' affirmance of\\nthe district court\\'s finding that Delacruz was in direct contempt of court for refusing to\\ntestify at a codefendant\\'s trial and the affirmance of the ensuing 108-month sentence\\nimposed for that contempt. Because the State did not offer Delacruz use and derivative\\nuse immunity that protected his constitutional right against self-incrimination, the district\\ncourt erred in holding Delacruz in contempt of court for invoking his constitutional right\\nto remain silent. We reverse the order of contempt and vacate the sentence.\\n\\nTrue\\tSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\tFACTUAL AND PROCEDURAL OVERVIEW\\n\\n       The State charged Delacruz with aggravated robbery and felony murder, based\\nupon an incident in which Joshua Haines was allegedly murdered during the commission\\nof a robbery by Delacruz and four others, including Anthony Waller. A jury convicted\\nDelacruz of aggravated robbery but acquitted him of felony murder; the court sentenced\\nDelacruz to an 83-month prison sentence. The conviction and sentence were upheld on\\nappeal. State v. Delacruz, No. 106,082, 2012 WL 1352865 (Kan. App. 2012)\\n(unpublished opinion), rev. denied 299 Kan. 1271 (2014) (Delacruz I).\\n\\n       After Delacruz\\' trial was completed, the State subpoenaed him to be a witness at\\nWaller\\'s murder trial. When Delacruz attempted to invoke his Fifth Amendment right\\nagainst self-incrimination, the State informed the district court that it was granting\\nDelacruz immunity for his testimony. The written grant of immunity proffered by the\\nState, titled \"GRANT OF USE IMMUNITY,\" stated:\\n               \"COMES NOW the Plaintiff, State of Kansas, by and through Reno County\\n       District Attorney of the 27th Judicial District, Keith E. Schroeder, pursuant to the\\n       authority vested in me as District Attorney, by K.S.A. 22-3415(a)(c), do hereby grant to:\\n       Jose G. Delacruz, immunity from the use of any testimony given in the above-captioned\\n       matter on February 28, 2011 through March 9, 2011. I, Keith E. Schroeder, District\\n       Attorney, grants [sic] this use immunity as described above with the legal assurance that\\n       such testimony will not be used against Jose G. Delacruz in any potential future case\\n       against Jose G. Delacruz. I, Keith E. Schroeder, District Attorney, condition this grant of\\n       use immunity as described on the condition that the testimony of Jose G. Delacruz must\\n       be truthful.\"\\n\\n       Delacruz argued that the grant of immunity did not preclude his invocation of\\nFifth Amendment rights because his aggravated robbery conviction was then on appeal\\nand because the written grant of immunity did not protect him from federal prosecution.\\nThe trial judge, Honorable Timothy J. Chambers, took the matter under advisement.\\n\\n       In the interim, the United States Attorney for the District of Kansas, Barry R.\\nGrissom, sent a letter to the district attorney stating that Grissom was familiar with the\\nfacts surrounding Delacruz\\' case and that while the letter did not act as a \"formal grant of\\nimmunity,\" no federal prosecution against Delacruz was warranted or would be\\nforthcoming for his involvement in the murder of Haines. Grissom opined that the federal\\nprosecution of Delacruz would violate the Department of Justice\\'s Petite policy. See\\nPetite v. United States, 361 U.S. 529, 530, 80 S. Ct. 450, 4 L. Ed. 2d 490 (1960) (a\\nfederal trial following a state prosecution for the same conduct generally barred).\\n\\n       Judge Chambers then issued an order stating: \"K.S.A. 22-3415 confers upon the\\nDistrict Attorney the authority to grant use and derivative immunity. Written immunity\\nhas been granted by the District Attorney to Jose Delacruz. Therefore, Jose Delacruz will\\nbe compelled to testify in the trial of the above captioned matter.\" (Emphasis added.) The\\ndistrict court apparently did not address the fact that the written document purported to\\ngrant only use immunity. See Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 453-54, 92 S. Ct.\\n1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212, reh. denied 408 U.S. 931 (1972) (mere use immunity insufficient\\nprotection under Fifth Amendment; use and derivative use immunity coextensive with\\nconstitutional privilege against self-incrimination).\\n\\n       Delacruz appeared before Judge Chambers three times during Waller\\'s trial and,\\nupon advice of counsel, refused the judge\\'s order to testify. Judge Chambers set a jury\\ntrial on the question of whether Delacruz was in direct criminal contempt of court for\\nrefusing to testify at Waller\\'s trial. Meanwhile, Waller was convicted of first-degree\\nfelony murder and aggravated kidnapping without Delacruz\\' testimony. See State v.\\nWaller, 299 Kan. 707, 328 P.3d 1111 (2014) (affirming convictions and sentences).\\nDelacruz\\' contempt case was reassigned to the Honorable Joseph L. McCarville III.\\n\\n       The State then filed an accusation of contempt, charging Delacruz with three\\ncounts of criminal contempt based on the theory that each time he appeared before Judge\\nChambers and refused to testify constituted a separate contemptuous act. The State\\ncomplained that Delacruz\\' refusal to testify made him unavailable for cross-examination,\\nrendered his video recorded statements inadmissible, and precluded the State from\\nexplaining to the jury why Delacruz was not called as a witness. The State asked for\\nconsecutive sentences of 36 months for each act of contempt, for a controlling sentence\\nof 108 months in prison, to be served consecutively to Delacruz\\' 83-month prison\\nsentence for aggravated robbery.\\n\\n       But when Delacruz appeared before Judge McCarville on May 23, 2011, the judge\\nrecited a different accusation of contempt to Delacruz. The court had sua sponte drafted a\\ncontempt accusation that alleged that Delacruz had committed one act of contempt for\\nfailing to comply with an order of the court \"to appear and testify under oath as a\\nwitness.\" Judge McCarville informed Delacruz that he would not impose a prison\\nsentence greater than the State\\'s recommendation of 108 months. Delacruz pled not guilty\\nand the matter was set for trial.\\n\\n       On the morning scheduled for trial, Judge McCarville denied Delacruz\\' motion to\\ndismiss based upon the claim that Judge Chambers\\' order to testify had violated Delacruz\\'\\nFifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Thereafter, Delacruz waived his right\\nto a jury trial and the case was submitted to Judge McCarville on stipulated facts. After\\nconsidering arguments, Judge McCarville stated,\\n       \"There is really no doubt that Mr. Delacruz didn\\'t comply with a direct order from\\n       District Judge Timothy J. Chambers, Division II, to testify in the Anthony Waller case\\n       and based upon my previous rulings there is no reasonable basis for him to have claimed\\n       the right not to testify under the Fifth Amendment so his refusal to testify was unlawful,\\n       was willful, was intentional and felonious and occurred here in Reno County in this court.\\n       The Court finds the defendant is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of felony criminal\\n       contempt of court as alleged in the accusation.\"\\n\\n       After finding Delacruz guilty of direct criminal contempt, Judge McCarville\\nproceeded to sentencing. The State adhered to its 108-month sentencing recommendation,\\nnotwithstanding the district court\\'s dismissal of two counts of the State\\'s original\\naccusation in contempt. Delacruz asked for a six-month sentence.\\n\\n       Before pronouncing sentence, Judge McCarville endeavored to provide the\\nreasoning behind his decision, albeit the court might have overlooked that it was the\\nState, not the defendant, that had sought to compel Delacruz\\' testimony. The court\\nexplained:\\n       \"The question here is not, this is not a case where we\\'re talking about somebody not\\n       taking their hat off or saying a bad word or not standing to address the Court or\\n       interrupting another attorney where those things are somewhat disruptive and do not lead\\n       to creation of the kind of atmosphere that we need to have in order for people to feel that\\n       when they come to court they can present, they can give their, they can present their case\\n       and witnesses can come to court and testify without having intimidation going in the\\n       courtroom or disruption or annoyance or disturbance. Those kind of things, that\\'s, in my\\n       opinion, are a little on a different level and a different plane. What we have in this case is\\n       an attack against the whole, the very essence of the judicial process.\\n\\nTrue\\tAPPLICATION\\t          III.Application.\\n\\t   \\n\\t   \"The reason that we\\'re talking about celebrating Veteran\\'s Day tomorrow,\\n       thousands and thousands of veterans have sacrificed their life to preserve our way of life;\\nthe most, in my opinion the most important of which is to have everyone treated the\\nsame, that in courts doesn\\'t matter who you are you have the same rights. Doesn\\'t matter\\nwho you are, you\\'re treated with the same respect and dignity and it doesn\\'t matter who\\nyou are if you\\'re the poorest person with the most depraved background, if you have a\\nwitness that you want to have testify . . . that has relevant and admissible evidence in\\nyour case then you have the right to have that person brought to court and compelled to\\ntestify. Defendants charged with murder or other heinous crimes have the right to expect\\nthat if they have a witness that\\'s going to help present their defense that the Court will\\nhave the power to bring that person in and make them testify in order to help them prove\\ntheir innocence and what Mr. Delacruz has done is to say well, maybe not so fast. It\\ndoesn\\'t apply when I decide that I\\'m not going to be the witness.\\n\"What I need to know is okay, what is a sufficient sentence to cause a person in\\nMr. Delacruz\\'s position to decide that he\\'d rather testify and take his chances with\\nwhatever repercussions there might be that his attorneys tell him about. What is enough\\nyears or months to get him to say I\\'m going to take the stand, I\\'m going to testify because\\nI do not want to degrade the authority of the Court. It\\'s certainly not six months. It\\ncertainly has to be a number of years. It doesn\\'t matter whether Mr. Delacruz received an\\n83-month sentence or a life sentence, you know, because we\\'re not talking about his\\nsentence for the crime that he was convicted of. We\\'re talking about what he did in this\\ncontempt.\\n\\n        \"What does this do to the dignity and the authority of the Court? I believe that I\\nhave a duty to, under Canon One and Canon Two under the [Code] of Judicial Conduct to\\nmaintain the authority and dignity of the Court and it\\'s not whether the attorney general\\ncame here. The attorney general would be assisting the Court by presenting evidence and\\nmaking arguments to assist the Court in figuring out the Court\\'s duty but the duty to\\npunish for contempt of court is not an executive branch function. It\\'s a duty that the Court\\nhas as a part of the essence of what a court is. We are [a] separate and co-equal branch of\\ngovernment and our purpose is to make sure that all parties have a tribunal in which they\\nhave access to compulsory process that\\'s effective. I don\\'t have anything to suggest that\\nany sentence less than 108 months would be sufficient to charge the Court\\'s\\nresponsibility. I realize that\\'s more than he got for the robbery but this is more serious\\n\\n       than robbery. This is an attack against our judicial system. This is more serious than\\n       armed robbery what you did, Mr. Delacruz . . . .\"\\n       Judge McCarville then sentenced Delacruz to 108 months in prison, to be served\\nconsecutive to the 83-month sentence for his aggravated robbery conviction. The\\nsubsequently filed journal entry recited that the court \"finds [Delacruz] guilty beyond a\\nreasonable doubt of Direct Criminal Contempt of Court, pursuant to K.S.A. 20-1203\" and\\nthat Delacruz would serve 108 months in prison consecutive to his 83-month sentence for\\naggravated robbery. The order further noted that Delacruz had waived his right to a jury\\ntrial and the matter proceeded to a bench trial on stipulated facts.\\n\\n       On appeal, the Court of Appeals affirmed the contempt conviction and sentence.\\nSee State v. Delacruz, 52 Kan. App. 2d 153, 172, 364 P.3d 557 (2015) (Delacruz II). The\\npanel rejected Delacruz\\' argument that he validly exercised his Fifth Amendment right to\\nrefuse to testify, opining that his claim that he was not immune from federal prosecution\\nlacked merit under In re Birdsong, 216 Kan. 297, 532 P.2d 1301 (1975). Delacruz II, 52\\nKan. App. 2d at 158-61. Moreover, the panel held that Delacruz had failed to establish\\nthat his testimony might form the basis for a violation of federal law, as required by the\\nplain language of K.S.A. 22-3415(c). While acknowledging that the letter from the U.S.\\nAttorney was not a formal grant of immunity, the panel declared that the letter clearly\\nstated that no federal prosecution would be forthcoming. 52 Kan. App. 2d at 1661.\\nWith respect to the length of the sentence, the panel held that the trial court did not\\nabuse its discretion in imposing the 108-month sentence, noting that the factors for\\ndetermining an appropriate sentence for criminal contempt set forth in United States v.\\nMine Workers, 330 U.S. 258, 303, 67 S. Ct. 677, 91 L. Ed. 884 (1947), supported the\\nsentence imposed. 52 Kan. App. 2d at 167-71.\\n\\n       On review, Delacruz claims that (1) the State\\'s grant of immunity was not\\ncoextensive with his rights against self-incrimination under both the United States and\\nKansas Constitutions and did not protect him against federal prosecution; and (2) the\\ndistrict court abused its discretion by imposing an excessive sentence of 108 months\\'\\nimprisonment.\\n\\nTrue\\tJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\\tJURISDICTIONAL DEFECT\\n\\n       Before reaching the merits of Delacruz\\' claims, we consider a jurisdictional\\nquestion raised sua sponte by this court. See Kaelter v. Sokol, 301 Kan. 247, 247, 340\\nP.3d 1210 (2015); State v. J.D.H., 48 Kan. App. 2d 454, 458, 294 P.3d 343, rev. denied\\n297 Kan. 1251 (2013) (appellate court has duty to question jurisdiction on own\\ninitiative). The parties were notified prior to oral arguments to be prepared to address the\\nfollowing issue: Whether the district court\\'s journal entry for direct contempt failed to\\ncomply with the written record requirement of K.S.A. 20-1203, rendering the contempt\\norder void for lack of jurisdiction.\\n\\nTrue\\tSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\tStandard of Review\\n\\n       Whether jurisdiction exists is a question of law over which this court\\'s scope of\\nreview is unlimited. State v. Dull, 302 Kan. 32, 61, 351 P.3d 641 (2015). Here, the\\njurisdictional question involves an interpretation of K.S.A. 20-1203; statutory\\ninterpretation is subject to unlimited review. State v. Collins, 303 Kan. 472, 473-74, 362\\nP.3d 1098 (2015).\\n\\nTrue\\tANALYSIS\\tAnalysis\\n\\n       A district court\\'s power to impose sanctions for contempt of court is regulated by\\nstatute. \"No inherent power to punish for contempt exists independent of K.S.A. 20-1201\\net seq.\" State v. Jenkins, 263 Kan. 351, 352, 950 P.2d 1338 (1997). \"Thus, to impose a\\nsanction against a contemnor, a court must follow the procedural requirements of K.S.A.\\n20-1201 et seq.\" In re M.R., 272 Kan. 1335, 1341, 38 P.3d 694 (2002).\\n\\n       In this case, the district court\\'s journal entry recites: \"The Court finds the\\nDefendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of Direct Criminal Contempt of Court,\\npursuant to K.S.A. 20-1203.\" Consequently, the district court was required to follow the\\nprocedural requirements set forth in K.S.A. 20-1203 as a condition precedent to imposing\\na sanction on Delacruz. That statute provides:\\n\\n               \"That a direct contempt may be punished summarily, without written accusation\\n       against the person arraigned, but if the court or judge in chambers shall adjudge [the\\n       accused] guilty [of direct contempt] a judgment shall be entered of record, in which shall\\n       be specified the conduct constituting such contempt, with a statement of whatever defense\\n       or extenuation the accused offered thereto, and the sentence of the court thereon.\"\\n       (Emphasis added.)\\n\\n       The journal entry in this case, filed on December 1, 2011, merely recited that the\\ndistrict court \"deliberates on the stipulation of facts, exhibits, applicable law and\\narguments of counsel\" and \"finds [Delacruz] guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of Direct\\nCriminal Contempt of Court, pursuant to K.S.A. 20-1203.\" In other words, the recorded\\njudgment of the court failed to specify the conduct constituting contempt and failed to\\nstate the defense or extenuation offered by the accused, both of which were statutorily\\nrequired under the contempt authority that Judge McCarville chose to utilize.\\n\\n       In Harsch v. Miller, 288 Kan. 280, 200 P.3d 467 (2009), we emphasized the\\nimportance of a district court properly recording a statute-compliant judgment of\\ncontempt when utilizing K.S.A. 20-1203 as the contempt authority. There, the district\\ncourt found plaintiff\\'s attorney in direct contempt of court under K.S.A. 20-1203 for\\nfailing to appear for trial, in contravention of a direct court order for the attorney to be\\npresent. Although the attorney had clearly and explicitly told the district court why the\\nattorney believed he should not have to appear for the trial, the \"journal entry contain[ed]\\nno reference as to why [the attorney] failed to appear, i.e., \\'a statement of whatever\\ndefense or extenuation [the attorney] offered.\\'\" The Harsch court held that the failure to\\ninclude K.S.A. 20-1203\\'s required content in the journal entry of contempt was a fatal\\njurisdictional defect that voided the direct contempt order, and the presence of the\\nrequisite information elsewhere in the record on appeal \"cannot cure the defect caused by\\n[its] absence in the journal entry.\" 288 Kan. at 295; cf. Padron v. Lopez, 289 Kan. 1089,\\n1106, 220 P.3d 345 (2009) (failure to comply with procedural requirements of indirect\\ncontempt statute K.S.A. 20-1204a is jurisdictional).\\n\\n       Harsch cited Jenkins, where this court discussed the compulsory statutory\\nprocedure for direct contempt:\\n       \"K.S.A. 20-1203 provides for summary punishment, but requires that a written judgment\\n       be entered, specifying the contemptuous conduct, defense or extenuating circumstances,\\n       and the sentence imposed. Failure to comply with 20-1203 is jurisdictional. See In re\\n       Gambrell, 160 Kan. 620, 623, 164 P.2d 122 (1945), reh. denied 161 Kan. 4, 165 P.2d 760\\n       (1946). . . .\\n\\n\\t   \"Direct contempt orders have been held void for either failure to specify the\\n       conduct constituting the contempt or to state any defense or extenuation offered by the\\n       accused. See, e.g., State v. Flanagan, 19 Kan. App. 2d 528, 533, 873 P.2d 195 (1994).\"\\n       (Emphasis added.) Jenkins, 263 Kan. at 357.\\n\\n       Likewise, in State v. Williams, 28 Kan. App. 2d 97, 11 P.3d 1187 (2000), the\\ndistrict court\\'s journal entry memorializing the sentencing hearing for a prospective juror\\nfound in direct contempt under K.S.A. 20-1203 failed to state the defenses or extenuating\\ncircumstances offered by the juror. When the prospective juror argued on appeal that the\\ncontempt order was void, the State countered with the argument that \"the purpose of the\\nrequirement of K.S.A. 20-1203 for a more detailed journal entry is to ensure a proper\\nrecord for appellate review and that the hearing transcript\\'s recording of [the prospective\\njuror\\'s] statement in her defense eliminates the need for such a journal entry in this case.\"\\n28 Kan. App. 2d at 101. The Court of Appeals panel rejected that argument, declaring\\nthat \"[t]he fact that we have access to a transcript of [the] sentencing hearing does not\\nexcuse the district court\\'s obligations under K.S.A. 20-1203.\" 28 Kan. App. 2d at 102.\\n\\n       Granted, K.S.A. 20-1203\\'s requirement of a judgment of record that specifies the\\ncontemptuous conduct and the accused\\'s defense or extenuation is preceded by statutory\\nlanguage that authorizes a summary punishment for a direct contempt without the need\\nfor a written accusation. One might presume the Legislature intended K.S.A. 20-1203\\'s\\nwritten judgment of record requirement to serve the purpose normally served by a written\\naccusation of contempt. And, in this case there were written accusations of contempt\\nfrom both the prosecutor and the presiding judge, and Delacruz was afforded the\\nopportunity for a trial on those accusations with counsel to represent his interests.\\nPerhaps more importantly, this court has recently revisited the notion of subject\\nmatter jurisdiction in the context of using that label for due process violations or\\nprocedural infirmities. See, e.g., State v. Dunn, 304 Kan. 773, 811, 375 P.3d 332 (2016)\\n(overruling long-standing precedent by holding that defective charging documents do not\\ndeprive state courts of subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate criminal cases); State v.\\nFord, 302 Kan. 455, 465, 353 P.3d 1143 (2015) (disapproving of precedent that had\\nreferred to procedural errors in the determination of defendant\\'s competency to stand trial\\nas depriving the district court of jurisdiction); cf. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500,\\n511, 126 S. Ct. 1235, 163 L. Ed. 2d 1097 (2006) (criticizing \"drive-by jurisdictional\\nrulings\" where courts fail to distinguish between subject matter jurisdiction and other\\ntypes of error); Sperry v. McKune, 305 Kan. 469, 486, 384 P.3d 1003 (2016) (citing to\\nChelf v. State, 46 Kan. App. 2d 522, 263 P.3d 852 [2011], for the proposition that the\\nfailure to exhaust administrative remedies does not deprive district court of subject matter\\njurisdiction).But unfortunately, because Delacruz did not challenge the district court\\'s\\njurisdiction or argue how the process utilized by the district court failed to comply with\\nthe mandates of K.S.A. 20-1203, the parties did not flesh out how the area of the law\\ninvolved in this case fits within this court\\'s changing concepts of subject matter\\njurisdiction. Moreover, the answer on the merits is especially clear in this case. See\\nAlvarado v. Holder, 743 F.3d 271, 276 (1st Cir. 2014) (holding that a court may \"put\\naside ambiguous jurisdictional questions\" under a statute \"when precedent clearly dictates\\nthe result on the merits\"); Sherrod v. Breitbart, 720 F.3d 932, 936-37 (D.C. Cir. 2013)\\n(holding that a court may presume jurisdiction and reach the merits when the answer to\\nthe merits issue is especially clear); Starkey ex rel. A.B. v. Boulder County Soc. Serv., 569\\nF.3d 1244, 1262-63 (10th Cir. 2009) (declining to consider a jurisdictional question\\nwhere the party claiming jurisdiction would clearly lose on the merits); accord In re\\nTodd, No. 110,958, 2014 WL 7152357, at *3 (Kan. App. 2014) (unpublished opinion)\\n(Leben, J., concurring) (\"In sum, the jurisdictional issue presents a fairly close question,\\nbut Todd cannot win on appeal on the merits. In these circumstances, I would simply rule\\non the merits and affirm the district court\\'s judgment, which denied relief.\"), rev. denied\\n302 Kan. 1010 (2015). Accordingly, we will presume, without deciding, that the district\\ncourt in this instance did not lose jurisdiction to find Delacruz in direct contempt of court\\nthrough a deficient journal entry.\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tFIFTH AMENDMENT PRIVILEGE AGAINST COMPULSORY SELF-INCRIMINATION\\n\\n       Delacruz has maintained from the beginning that he had a valid Fifth Amendment\\nright to refuse to testify because the immunity granted to him was not coextensive with\\nhis constitutional right against self-incrimination. We agree with that assertion.\\n\\nTrue\\tSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\tStandard of Review\\n\\n       In clarifying the standard of review for a Fifth Amendment self-incrimination\\nclaim, this court has stated:\\n               \"When asked to review the violation of a defendant\\'s Fifth Amendment right\\n       against self-incrimination, this court reviews the district court\\'s factual findings using a\\n       substantial competent evidence standard, but the ultimate legal conclusion is reviewed as\\n       a question of law using an unlimited standard of review. State v. Bell, 280 Kan. 358, 362,\\n       121 P.3d 972 (2005).\" State v. Carapezza, 286 Kan. 992, 1007, 191 P.3d 256 (2008);\\n       State v. Hughes, 286 Kan. 1010, 1029, 191 P.3d 268 (2008).\\n\\nTrue\\tANALYSIS\\tAnalysis\\n\\n       It is undisputed that Delacruz failed to obey a direct order from the district court\\nwhen he refused to testify at Waller\\'s trial. But \"the power to compel testimony is not\\nabsolute,\" and the most important exception to that power is the Fifth Amendment\\nprivilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441,\\n444, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972). Specifically, the Fifth Amendment to the\\nConstitution of the United States declares that \"[n]o person . . . shall be compelled in any\\ncriminal case to be a witness against himself . . . .\" See also Kansas Constitution Bill of\\nRights Â§ 10 (\"No person shall be a witness against himself . . . .\"); K.S.A. 60-425\\n(granting every natural person a privilege to refuse to disclose \"any matter that will\\nincriminate such person\"). The privilege afforded not only applies to a witness\\' answers\\nthat would directly support a criminal conviction but also embraces those answers which\\nwould furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a\\ncrime. Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479, 486, 71 S. Ct. 814, 95 L. Ed. 1118 (1951).\\n\\n       On the other hand, a witness who has no reasonable cause to fear incrimination\\ncannot invoke the right. Hoffman, 341 U.S. at 486. One manner in which the State can\\nremove the fear of incrimination and compel testimony is to grant the witness immunity\\nin return for the witness\\' testimony. But not all grants of immunity will satisfy the\\nconstraints of the right against self-incrimination. As our Court of Appeals noted over\\ntwo decades ago:\\n\\n               \"\\'There are three recognized types of immunity: (1) \"transactional,\" (2) \"use and\\n       derivative use,\" and, (3) \"use.\" \"Transactional\" immunity protects the witness from\\n       prosecution for offenses to which the compelled testimony relates. This type of immunity\\n       is broader than the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and need not always\\n       be granted, although it does, of course, constitute adequate immunity. \"Use and\\n       derivative use\" immunity protects the witness from the use of compelled testimony and\\n       evidence derived therefrom. It is coextensive with the constitutional privilege against\\n       self-incrimination and is therefore a sufficient grant of immunity to compel self-\\n       incriminatory testimony. On the other hand, mere \"use\" immunity, which only prevents\\n       the prosecution from using the compelled testimony in any criminal proceeding, is not\\n       constitutionally adequate since it does not prevent prosecuting authorities from making\\n       derivative use of the fruits of a witness\\' compelled testimony by obtaining investigatory\\n       leads from it.\\'\" Cabral v. State, 19 Kan. App. 2d 456, 460-61, 871 P.2d 1285 (1994).\\n       Cabral cited to this court\\'s prior decision in State v. Durrant, 244 Kan. 522, 534,\\n769 P.2d 1174 (1989), which held:\\n       \"For a statutory grant of immunity to be coextensive with the privilege against self-\\n       incrimination, it must grant not only use immunity, or protection from the direct use of\\n       compelled incriminatory information, but also derivative-use immunity, which prohibits\\n       use of any such information for investigatory purposes leading to other evidence of\\n       criminal activity.\"\\n\\nDurrant was consistent with the landmark case of Kastigar, which, as noted above, held\\nthat if the government wants to compel testimony from a witness claiming the Fifth\\nAmendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, it must grant the witness at\\nleast use and derivative use immunity, otherwise a citation in contempt must be reversed.\\nHere, the State expressly granted Delacruz mere use immunity. To reiterate, the\\nwritten document provided to Delacruz was entitled, \"GRANT OF USE IMMUNITY,\"\\nand stated in the body that Delacruz was being granted \"immunity from the use of any\\ntestimony given in the above-captioned matter on February 28, 2011 through March 9,\\n2011.\" The document went on to explain that the use immunity being granted meant that\\nDelacruz\\' testimony would not be used against him in any potential future case. The\\ndocument did not mention the use of any evidence that might be derived from the\\ncompelled testimony. As Kastigar explained, the derivative use component of a\\ncoextensive grant of immunity is important because it \"[bars] the use of any evidence\\nobtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.\"\\n406 U.S. at 460. The State\\'s grant of immunity to Delacruz plainly did not include this\\nimportant component.\\n\\n       Curiously, the grant of immunity document refers to the statute dealing with\\nimmunities, K.S.A. 22-3415, which specifically refers to use and derivative use immunity\\nunder subsection (b)(2). But the immunity document does not purport to incorporate that\\nstatutory definition by reference; rather, it recites that the immunity is being granted\\n\"pursuant to the authority vested in me as District Attorney, by K.S.A. 22-3415(a) [and]\\n(c).\" Those subsections, (a) and (c), have nothing to do with the type of immunity being\\ngranted. In other words, no reasonable inference on the type of immunity being granted\\ncan be discerned from the statutory reference.\\n\\n       To summarize, the State granted Delacruz use immunity; the use immunity\\ngranted was not coextensive with Delacruz\\' constitutional right against self-incrimination;\\ntherefore, Judge Chambers\\' order compelling Delacruz\\' testimony at the Waller trial\\nviolated Delacruz\\' constitutional right against self-incrimination and was unlawful.\\nConsequently, Judge McCarville\\'s ensuing order, finding Delacruz in direct contempt of\\ncourt for refusing to testify and sentencing him to a consecutive 108-month prison term,\\nwas likewise unlawful.\\n\\n       Accordingly, we reverse Judge McCarville\\'s order of contempt and vacate the 108-\\nmonth sentence. We note this holding appears to require recomputing the \"sentence\\nbegins date\" for Delacruz with appropriate credit given on any sentence or sentences\\nremaining. See K.A.R. 44-6-138(c) (2017 Supp.) (requiring recomputing of sentence\\nbegins date when one or more sentences in an aggregated sentence are vacated).\\n\\n\\n\\n 03/02/2018\\n        IN THE COURT OF CRIMINAL APPEALS OF TENNESSEE\\n                         AT NASHVILLE\\n                          Assigned on Briefs May 10, 2017\\n         STATE OF TENNESSEE v.

Factual Background\\n\\n       The Appellant was indicted for violating an order declaring him to be a motor\\nvehicle habitual offender (MVHO), a Class E felony; failing to provide evidence of\\nfinancial responsibility, a Class C misdemeanor; and passing another vehicle in a no\\npassing zone, a Class C misdemeanor. See Tenn. Code Ann. Â§Â§ 55-10-616; 55-12-139;\\n55-8-121.\\n\\n       On September 11, 2015, the State filed a motion in limine asking the trial court to\\nprohibit the Appellant from collaterally attacking the validity of the MVHO order. Citing\\nState v. William Tony Wright, No. M2001-01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655\\n(Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, June 19, 2002), the State contended that any argument or\\ntestimony suggesting the Appellant had no notice of the MVHO order was misleading\\nbecause the Appellant had been convicted of violating the MVHO order on three prior\\noccasions; therefore, such argument or testimony was inadmissible.\\n\\n        On September 30, 2015, immediately prior to trial, the trial court granted the\\nStateâ\\x80\\x99s motion. Defense counsel informed the trial court that he did not plan to\\ncollaterally attack the MVHO order. Instead, the defense strategy was to show that the\\nState did not introduce proof the Appellant had notice of the MVHO order and that,\\naccordingly, the State could not prove the Appellant intentionally, knowingly, or\\nrecklessly violated the MVHO order. The State then suggested that the easiest way to\\nestablish the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s awareness of the MVHO order was to introduce proof of the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s prior convictions of violating the order. Defense counsel responded that the\\nState could prove the Appellant had notice of the order without informing the jury that\\nthe Appellant had prior convictions of the same crime, which were â\\x80\\x9cmore prejudicial than\\nprobative.â\\x80\\x9d The trial court warned that if the Appellant proceeded with the argument he\\ndid not have notice of the MVHO order, it would allow the State to rebut the claim by\\nintroducing â\\x80\\x9cdocuments regarding service of process and awareness of court dates.â\\x80\\x9d The\\nState again noted the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s three prior convictions of violating the MVHO order\\nand argued that because of those convictions, the Appellant was prohibited from asserting\\nhe had no notice of the order according to case law. The trial court agreed that the State\\ncould not â\\x80\\x9ctry the case with its hands behind its back like that,â\\x80\\x9d and reiterated its warning\\nthat if defense counsel raised the issue of notice, it would allow the State to rebut the\\ndefenseâ\\x80\\x99s claims. Nevertheless, the trial court stated that it would not allow the State to\\nintroduce proof of the prior convictions until the Appellant â\\x80\\x9copens that door.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n        At trial, Chapel Hill Police Officer Andrew Kon testified that at 9:40 p.m. on\\nTuesday, March 31, 2015, he was driving his marked patrol car north on Highway 31-A\\nin the area of Henry Horton Park when he saw a red Chevrolet Monte Carlo that was\\ntraveling southbound pass a blue Ford Expedition. Officer Kon saw the headlights of the\\nMonte Carlo two or three hundred yards in front of his car â\\x80\\x9ccoming towardâ\\x80\\x9d him. Officer\\nKon said that although it was dark, the double yellow line indicating it was a no passing\\nzone was clearly visible. Officer Kon made a U-turn and activated his patrol carâ\\x80\\x99s blue\\nlights to initiate a traffic stop.\\n\\n        The red Monte Carlo stopped in a Dollar General Store parking lot. Officer Kon\\nparked and approached the Appellant, who was the driver. Officer Kon advised the\\nAppellant that he had been stopped for passing another vehicle in a no passing zone. He\\nasked for the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driverâ\\x80\\x99s license, automobile registration, and proof of\\ninsurance, but the Appellant did not produce the documents. Officer Kon requested the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s name and date of birth, then he conveyed the information he obtained to the\\npolice dispatcher. After receiving a response from the dispatcher, Officer Kon arrested\\nthe Appellant for driving on a revoked license, violating a MVHO order, failing to\\nprovide proof of financial responsibility, and improper passing. Officer Kon recalled that\\nother vehicles were on the roadway when the Appellant passed the Expedition.\\nOn cross-examination, Officer Kon acknowledged that the Appellant did not cause\\nan accident and that no one was injured.\\n\\n       Nicholas Kiefer testified that he was a deputy clerk in the Davidson County\\nCriminal Court Clerkâ\\x80\\x99s Office and that he was a â\\x80\\x9ckeeper of the records.â\\x80\\x9d From the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s file, Kiefer identified a certified copy of an â\\x80\\x9cOrder to Appear . . . in an\\nhabitual offender matter.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer explained that according to the order, the Appellant\\nwas ordered â\\x80\\x9cto appear before the criminal court on the 19th of January, 2005, to show\\ncause why he should not be declared an habitual traffic offender.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer said that on the\\nsecond page of the order was a â\\x80\\x9ccertificate of service from the deputy sheriff.â\\x80\\x9d\\nKiefer identified another order by the Davidson County Criminal Court, which\\nstated that the Appellant was declared to be an habitual traffic offender. The order,\\nwhich was dated January 20, 2005, prohibited the Appellant from driving for three years\\nand ordered that he surrender his license to the court. On the second page of the order\\nwas a signed certificate of service reflecting that a â\\x80\\x9cTrue and exact copyâ\\x80\\x9d of the order had\\nbeen â\\x80\\x9cmailed or hand-deliveredâ\\x80\\x9d to the Appellant â\\x80\\x9cand/orâ\\x80\\x9d his attorney.\\nKiefer also identified a â\\x80\\x9ccertified copy of what we call a file jacket. Itâ\\x80\\x99s the front\\nof the file that â\\x80\\x93 itâ\\x80\\x99s the front of what would be a criminal case file.â\\x80\\x9d He explained that\\nâ\\x80\\x9conly two specific clerksâ\\x80\\x9d in the office made notations on the front of the file jacket. The\\ngrand jury clerk wrote the case number, the division assignment, and the reason for the\\ncase. The â\\x80\\x9cjudgeâ\\x80\\x99s in-court clerkâ\\x80\\x9d wrote the date of the docket and â\\x80\\x9cnotations similar to\\nwhat would be on a minute entry.â\\x80\\x9d Kiefer examined the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s file jacket and\\nnoticed that the first date listed was January 19, 2005. Kiefer said, â\\x80\\x9cThe notation for that\\nday states that the [Appellant], Mr. William Hanson, was served and that the case was\\nreset.â\\x80\\x9d The next date listed was January 20, 2005, which was the same date the MVHO\\norder was entered.\\n\\n        On cross-examination, Kiefer acknowledged that he began working in the clerkâ\\x80\\x99s\\noffice in 2011 and that he was not present for any of the 2005 court proceedings.\\n        Glendora Graves testified that she was a district manager with the Tennessee\\nDepartment of Safety and Homeland Security. Through her employment, she had access\\nto driving histories. In preparation for trial, she accessed the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving history,\\nwhich included a January 20, 2005 order declaring the Appellant to be a MVHO. The\\norder resulted in the revocation of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s license. Graves stated that the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges were never restored and that the order was in effect on the\\nday of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s arrest.\\nOn cross-examination, Graves acknowledged that the branch of the Department of\\nSafety and Homeland Security which was responsible for maintaining driving records\\nwas located in Nashville. She further acknowledged that she did not maintain the driving\\nrecords. She also acknowledged that sometimes a driving record contained incorrect\\ninformation but that it did not happen often.\\nOn redirect examination, Graves asserted that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record had\\nâ\\x80\\x9cbeen certified as True and accurate by Susan Lowe of the financial responsibility\\ndivision.â\\x80\\x9d\\n\\n       The jury convicted the Appellant as charged. On appeal, the Appellant contends\\nthat the trial court erred by granting the Stateâ\\x80\\x99s motion to prohibit the Appellant from\\ncollaterally attacking the motor vehicle habitual offender order, by limiting the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s\\nclosing argument, and by admitting the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record into evidence through\\nStateâ\\x80\\x99s witness from the Department of Safety and Homeland Security. The Appellant\\nalso contends that the evidence was insufficient to sustain his conviction for violating an\\norder declaring him to be a motor vehicle habitual offender.\\n\\nTrue\\tANALYSIS\\tII. Analysis\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tA. Collateral Attack on MVHO Order\\n\\n       As his first issue, the Appellant contends that he â\\x80\\x9cmakes a good faith argument for\\n[a] change in the law thus allowing this case to be remanded to allow collateral attack on\\nthe Davidson County [MVHO] Order.â\\x80\\x9d In the trial court, the Appellant repeatedly\\nasserted that he was not collaterally attacking the MVHO order and was instead claiming\\nthat the State failed to prove he received notice of the order and thus failed to prove he\\nviolated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. On appeal, however, the\\nAppellant concedes that he is collaterally attacking the MVHO order.1 The Appellant\\ncontends that the trial court misconsTrued State v. William Tony Wright, No. M2001-\\n\\n         We caution that â\\x80\\x9can appellant is bound by the evidentiary theory set forth at trial, and may not\\nchange theories on appeal.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Alder, 71 S.W.3d 299, 303 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2001).\\n01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, June 19, 2002),\\nas authority to grant the Stateâ\\x80\\x99s motion in limine restricting collateral attack on the\\nMVHO order. He maintains that Wright did not stand for the proposition that a\\ndefendant could not collaterally attack an MVHO order. The Appellant did not cite any\\nother cases in support of his contention. The Appellant contends that the trial courtâ\\x80\\x99s\\nerroneous ruling limited his ability to argue that the State had failed to prove that the\\nAppellant knew about the MVHO order and, accordingly, that the Appellant could not\\nhave violated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly.\\n\\n       This court has explained previously that â\\x80\\x9c[a] proceeding under the Motor Vehicle\\nHabitual Offender Act is civil in nature and therefore is governed by the Tennessee Rules\\nof Civil Procedure.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Malady, 952 S.W.2d 440, 444 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1996). As\\nthe State notes, this court has held consistently that a defendant cannot collaterally attack\\nan order declaring him to be a MVHO. See Davis v. State, 793 S.W.2d 650, 651 (Tenn.\\nCrim. App. 1990); Everhart v. State, 563 S.W.2d 795, 797-98 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1978);\\nState v. Tony Lynn Allen, No. M2007-00826-CCA-R3-CD, 2008 WL 2743882, at *3\\n(Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, July 15, 2008); State v. Nelson Keith Foster, No. E2001-\\n02976-CCA-RM-CD, 2002 WL 181359, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Nashville, Feb. 1,\\n2002); State v. Michael Samuel Eidson, No. 03C01-9711-CR-00506, 1999 WL 160944,\\nat *1 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Knoxville, Mar. 24, 1999). Instead, â\\x80\\x9cthe appropriate\\nprocedure for challenging a habitual [motor vehicle] offender order is to file a motion\\npursuant to Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Ernest Michael Turner,\\nNo. W2006-02661-CCA-R3-CD, 2008 WL 1700338, at *5 (Tenn. Crim. App. at Jackson,\\nApr. 4, 2008) (citing Bankston v. State, 815 S.W.2d 213, 216 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991)).We agree with the State that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s arguments regarding Wright are â\\x80\\x9cnot\\nentirely accurate.â\\x80\\x9d The Appellant contends that the defendant in Wright was allowed to\\ncollaterally attack the MVHO order. However, in Wright, the defendant pled guilty to\\nviolating an MVHO order. Wright, No. M2001-01418-CCA-R3-CD, 2002 WL 1336655,\\nat *1. Thereafter, he filed a motion to withdraw the guilty plea, arguing that he was\\nâ\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98legally innocentâ\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d of the violation because the order did not comply with Tennessee\\nRule of Civil Procedure 58. Id. Simultaneously, the defendant filed a motion\\nchallenging the MVHO order under Tennessee Rule of Civil Procedure 60.02. Id. at *2.\\nOn appeal, this court determined that the defendantâ\\x80\\x99s issues turned upon whether he was\\nentitled to relief under Rule 60.02 and, after consideration, held that â\\x80\\x9cthe trial court did\\nnot err in denying [the defendantâ\\x80\\x99s] motion for relief from the order declaring him to be a\\nmotor vehicle habitual offender.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at *4.\\n\\n      The record before us does not reflect that the Appellant ever filed a motion\\npursuant to Rule 60.02 challenging the MVHO order, and he has not filed such a motion\\nin the instant case. Moreover, the State did not argue that Wright stood for the\\nproposition that an MVHO order could not be collaterally attacked; instead, the State\\ncited Wright to support the proposition that a defendant who had pled guilty to violating\\nthe MVHO order previously consequently has notice of the order. We agree. The\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s arguments are unavailing.\\n\\nTrue\\tARGUMENT\\tB. Closing Argument\\n\\n        The Appellant next contends that the trial court erred by limiting defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s\\nability to argue during closing argument that the State introduced no proof the Appellant\\nhad notice of the MVHO order and that, accordingly, he could not have intentionally,\\nknowingly, or recklessly violated the order. The State responds that the Appellant is not\\nentitled to relief on this issue.\\n\\n        It is well-established that closing argument is an important tool for both parties\\nduring a trial; thus, counsel is generally given wide latitude during closing argument, and\\nthe trial court is granted wide discretion in controlling closing arguments. See State v.\\nCarruthers, 35 S.W.3d 516, 577-78 (Tenn. 2000) (appendix). â\\x80\\x9cNotwithstanding such,\\narguments must be temperate, based upon the evidence introduced at trial, relevant to the\\nissues being tried, and not otherwise improper under the facts or law.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Goltz,\\n111 S.W.3d 1, 5 (Tenn. Crim. App. 2003).\\n\\n       The record reflects that during closing argument, defense counsel acknowledged\\nthat the State had shown the jury the MVHO order but argued that it was required also to\\nprove that the Appellant intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly violated the order.\\nDefense counsel told the jury that all three mental states â\\x80\\x9crequire [the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s]\\nknowledge. That he knew this [order] existed.â\\x80\\x9d Defense counsel contended, however,\\nthe State presented no witnesses who testified that they saw the order being given to the\\nAppellant or that he was in court the day the order was issued. The State objected to\\ndefense counselâ\\x80\\x99s argument as a collateral attack on the MVHO order after the proof was\\nclosed. Defense counsel responded that he was not arguing that the order was invalid.\\nThe trial court said that it was being â\\x80\\x9cliberalâ\\x80\\x9d with defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s argument but\\ncautioned that if defense counsel went â\\x80\\x9ctoo far,â\\x80\\x9d it would let the State respond â\\x80\\x9cwithin the\\nconfines of the proof.â\\x80\\x9d The trial court agreed that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s prior convictions were\\nnot part of the proof; nevertheless, the court observed that defense counsel was\\nattempting to â\\x80\\x9csand bagâ\\x80\\x9d the State by claiming the Appellant had no notice of the MVHO\\norder after the proof was closed in order to render the State unable to rebut the claim.\\n\\n       Defense counsel maintained that the State could have introduced the minutes or\\ntranscript of the MVHO hearing or called the district attorney who prosecuted that case to\\nprove the Appellant had knowledge of the MVHO order. However, the trial court\\nresponded that the State was not required to go to such lengths to prove the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s\\nknowledge of the order and that it was â\\x80\\x9cdis[i]ngenuousâ\\x80\\x9d for defense counsel to argue that\\nthe Appellant did not have notice of the MVHO order. The trial court allowed defense\\ncounsel to argue â\\x80\\x9cabout what is on the orderâ\\x80\\x9d but refused to let him argue that the\\nAppellant did not have notice of the order. The court cautioned that if defense counsel\\npersisted in his argument, the court might â\\x80\\x9chave to craft a specific instruction,â\\x80\\x9d noting\\nthat the standard MVHO instruction did not explain that the State did not â\\x80\\x9chave to prove\\na negative. They have to prove there was an order and he drove.â\\x80\\x9d\\nInitially, we note that the Appellant failed to cite any authority in support of his\\nargument that the trial court erred by limiting his closing argument. Generally, â\\x80\\x9c[i]ssues\\nwhich are not supported by argument, citation to authorities, or appropriate references to\\nthe record will be treated as waived in this court.â\\x80\\x9d Tenn. Ct. Crim. App. R. 10(b); see\\nTenn. R. App. P. 27(a)(7).\\nFurther, the Appellant argues that the trial court warned defense counsel that if he\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccontinued this sort of argument, that the Court would allow the State to present to the\\njury evidence to show the [Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s] knowledge of the [MVHO] order.â\\x80\\x9d The\\nAppellant provided no citation to the record where the court issued the foregoing\\nwarning. Our review of the record reveals that the trial court issued no such warning;\\ninstead, the trial court told the Appellant that it would allow the State to â\\x80\\x9cdo what they\\nhave got to do within the confines of the proofâ\\x80\\x9d and that the trial court would fashion a\\nspecial jury instruction to inform the jury that the State did not have to prove the\\nAppellant was in court on the day the MVHO order was issued.\\n\\n       Moreover, once defense counsel continued his closing argument, he argued to the\\njury that the certificate of service on the second page of the MVHO order was â\\x80\\x9cpro\\nformaâ\\x80\\x9d and did not specify the method in which the order may have been delivered to the\\nAppellant. Defense counsel also argued that Kiefer did not work at the court at the time\\nthe order was issued and therefore could not testify specifically about how the Appellant\\nreceived the order, whether it was mailed or hand-delivered, and could not assert that the\\nAppellant definitively had received the order. Although defense counsel was allowed to\\nmake this argument, it was inappropriate and an attempt to collaterally attack the\\nunderlying judgment. The Appellant is not entitled to relief on this issue.\\n\\nTrue\\tTESTIMONY\\tC. Gravesâ\\x80\\x99s Testimony\\n\\n\\t       As his next issue, the Appellant argues that Graves was not qualified to testify\\nabout his driving record because she was not the keeper of the records at the Department\\nof Safety and Homeland Security and that the driving record was not a self-authenticating\\ndocument. He complains that the trial court required the Appellant to choose between\\nallowing Graves to testify that his driving privileges had not been reinstated since the\\nMVHO order or allowing the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s redacted driving history to be entered into\\nevidence as a self-authenticating document. The State responds that the Appellant has\\nwaived the issue by failing to include the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record in the appellate\\nrecord for our review. In the alternative, the State argues that the trial court did not err by\\nlimiting Gravesâ\\x80\\x99s testimony to whether the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges had been\\nreinstated. We agree with the State.\\nDuring a jury-out hearing, the State announced that it intended to call Glendora\\nGraves as the keeper of the records of the Department of Safety and Homeland Security.\\nShe said that her department was responsible for issuing driverâ\\x80\\x99s licenses and keeping\\ninformation regarding driverâ\\x80\\x99s histories. Graves asserted that the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving\\nhistory reflected that his driverâ\\x80\\x99s license had been revoked and had never been reinstated.\\n\\nTrue\\tSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\tII. STATEMENT OF FACTS\\n\\n       Defense counsel objected to Graves being allowed to testify, arguing that although\\nshe could access the records, she was not the keeper of the records. The trial court asked\\nwhether the records were self-authenticating. The State responded that the records were\\nself-authenticating.\\n\\n        We are unable to address any of the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s concerns regarding whether the\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving record was self-authenticating because the Appellant failed to include\\nthe driving record in the appellate record for our review. The Appellant carries the\\nburden of ensuring that the record on appeal conveys a fair, accurate, and complete\\naccount of what has transpired with respect to those issues that are the bases of appeal.\\nTenn. R. App. P. 24(b); see also Thompson v. State, 958 S.W.2d 156, 172 (Tenn. Crim.\\nApp. 1997). â\\x80\\x9cIn the absence of an adequate record on appeal, this court must presume\\nthat the trial courtâ\\x80\\x99s rulings were supported by sufficient evidence.â\\x80\\x9d State v. Oody, 823\\nS.W.2d 554, 559 (Tenn. Crim. App. 1991). Accordingly, the Appellant is not entitled to\\nrelief on this issue.\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tD. Sufficiency of the Evidence\\n\\n       As his final issue, the Appellant challenges the sufficiency of the evidence\\nsustaining his conviction for violating the MVHO order, asserting that the State failed to\\nprove that he violated the order intentionally, knowingly, or recklessly. The State\\nresponds that the proof was sufficient. On appeal, a jury conviction removes the\\npresumption of the appellantâ\\x80\\x99s innocence and replaces it with one of guilt, so that the\\nappellant carries the burden of demonstrating to this court why the evidence will not\\nsupport the juryâ\\x80\\x99s findings. See State v. Tuggle, 639 S.W.2d 913, 914 (Tenn. 1982). The\\nappellant must establish that no reasonable trier of fact could have found the essential\\nelements of the offense beyond a reasonable doubt. See Jackson v. Virginia, 443 U.S.\\n307, 319 (1979); Tenn. R. App. P. 13(e).\\n\\n      Accordingly, on appeal, the State is entitled to the strongest legitimate view of the\\nevidence and all reasonable inferences which may be drawn therefrom. See State v.\\nWilliams, 657 S.W.2d 405, 410 (Tenn. 1983). In other words, questions concerning the\\ncredibility of witnesses and the weight and value to be given the evidence, as well as all\\nfactual issues raised by the evidence, are resolved by the trier of fact, and not the\\nappellate courts. See State v. Pruett, 788 S.W.2d 559, 561 (Tenn. 1990).\\n\\n       The guilt of a defendant, including any fact required to be proven, may be\\npredicated upon direct evidence, circumstantial evidence, or a combination of both direct\\nand circumstantial evidence. See State v. Pendergrass, 13 S.W.3d 389, 392-93 (Tenn.\\nCrim. App. 1999). Even though convictions may be established by different forms of\\nevidence, the standard of review for the sufficiency of that evidence is the same whether\\nthe conviction is based upon direct or circumstantial evidence. See State v. Dorantes,\\n331 S.W.3d 370, 379 (Tenn. 2011).\\n\\nTrue\\tANALYSIS                        V. ANALYSIS\\n\\n        This court previously has observed that in order to sustain a conviction under\\nTennessee Code Annotated section 55-10-616(a), the State must â\\x80\\x9cprove (1) that [the\\nA]ppellant was subject to a judgment or order prohibiting him from operating a motor\\nvehicle and (2) that he operated a motor vehicle while that judgment or order was in\\neffect.â\\x80\\x9d State v.

STANDARDS OF REVIEW\\n\\n        In the light most favorable to the State, the proof adduced at trial revealed that on\\nthe evening of March 31, 2015, Officer Kon was driving north on Highway 31-A when\\nhe saw a red Monte Carlo pass a blue Ford Expedition in a no passing zone. Officer Kon\\nstopped the Monte Carlo, which was being driven by the Appellant. The Appellant was\\nunable to produce his driverâ\\x80\\x99s license, automobile registration, or proof of insurance.\\nDavidson County Criminal Court records reflected that on January 19, 2005, the court\\nissued an order for the Appellant to appear in an habitual traffic offender matter. On the\\norder was a certificate of service from the deputy sheriff. The court records also reflected\\nthat on January 20, 2005, the court issued an order declaring the Appellant an habitual\\ntraffic offender. The second page of the order reflected that a copy of the order was to be\\nsent to the Appellant or his attorney and also reflected a signed certificate of service. The\\nAppellantâ\\x80\\x99s driving privileges were never restored. We conclude that the foregoing\\nevidence was sufficient to sustain the Appellantâ\\x80\\x99s conviction of violating an MVHO\\norder.\\n\\nTrue\\tCONCLUSION\\tIII. Conclusion\\n\\n      In sum, we conclude that the Appellant is not entitled to relief on any of his issues.\\nThe judgments of the trial court are affirmed.\\n\\n\\n\\n      A Lincoln County Grand Jury indicted Appellant, Timothy Robinson, of\\nfirst-degree sodomy (victim less than twelve years old), incest (victim less than\\ntwelve years old), and use of a minor in a sexual performance (victim less than\\ntwelve years old). A Lincoln Circuit Court jury found him guilty of all three\\ncharges and recommended sentences of life imprisonment for sodomy, fifty\\nyears\\' imprisonment for incest, and twenty years\\' imprisonment for use of a\\nminor in a sexual performance. Appellant now appeals as a matter of right, Ky.\\nConst. Â§ 110(2)(b), and raises the following issues: (1) he was unfairly\\nprejudiced by the trial court\\'s joinder of his case with his brother\\'s, (2) the trial\\ncourt erroneously admitted evidence of numerous bad acts, and (3) the trial\\ncourt erred in ordering that his sentence in the case at bar be run\\nconsecutively to a sentence he was already serving in a separate case.\\n\\nTrue\\tBACKGROUND\\tI. BACKGROUND\\n\\n     Appellant lived in a two-bedroom mobile home with his wife, the couple\\'s\\nseven children, and one of his step-daughters, Suzie. 1 Appellant\\'s brother,\\nJames Matthew Robinson (Matt), visited Appellant\\'s home frequently, often\\ndrinking beer with Appellant until both were intoxicated. Several witnesses\\ntestified at trial that the events described below took place when Appellant and\\nMatt got drunk.\\n\\n      Appellant and Matt were each charged with the first-degree sodomy of\\nAppellant\\'s son, Sam, who was under the age of twelve at the time the abuse\\noccurred. Appellant was also indicted for incest and use of a minor in a sexual\\nperformanceâ\\x80\\x94both these counts related to his sodomy of Sam. The Grand\\nJury indicted Matt of seven counts of use of a minor in a sexual performance\\nand six counts of first-degree sexual abuse in a separate indictment. All of\\nMatt\\'s charges concerned Appellant\\'s children and Suzie.\\n\\nTrue\\tANALYSIS\\tII. ANALYSIS\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tA. Joinder\\n\\n      Over Appellant\\'s objection and motion to sever, the trial court granted\\nthe Commonwealth\\'s motion to consolidate the two indictments and heard the\\nbrothers\\' cases jointly, as the two were \"alleged to have participated in the\\nsame act or transaction . . . constituting an offense.\" RCr 6.20. All but one of\\nWe have changed the names of the minors in this opinion.\\nMatt\\'s charges were brought in a separate indictment from Appellant\\'s,\\nhowever, RCr 9.12 provides:\\n\\n      The court may order two (2) or more indictments, informations,\\n      complaints or uniform citations to be tried together if the offenses,\\n      and the defendants, if more than one (1), could have been joined in\\n      a single indictment, information, complaint or uniform citation.\\n      The procedure shall be the same as if the prosecution were under a\\n      single indictment, information, complaint or uniform citation.\\n\\n      Appellant argues that he was prejudiced by the joinder of his and Matt\\'s\\ncases. Pursuant to RCr 8.31, lig it appears that a defendant or the\\nCommonwealth is or will be prejudiced by a joinder of offenses or of defendants\\nin an indictment, information, complaint or uniform citation or by joinder for\\ntrial, the court shall order separate trials of counts, grant separate trials of\\ndefendants or provide whatever other relief justice requires.\" As this Court\\nrecently held, \"[w]e review the trial court\\'s denial of a motion to sever for abuse\\nof discretion . . . and the burden is on the appellant to show that the denial\\nwas in fact unfairly prejudicial.\" Peacher v. Commonwealth, 391 S.W.3d 821,\\n834 (Ky. 2013) (citing Quisenberry v. Commonwealth, 336 S.W.3d 19 (Ky.\\n2011)); see also Rearick v. Commonwealth, 858 S.W.2d 185, 187 (Ky. 1993)\\n(\"We start with the general proposition that a trial court has broad discretion\\nwith respect to joinder, and will not, be overturned absent a showing of\\nprejudice and clear abuse of discretion.\"); Rachel v. Commonwealth, 523\\nS.W.2d 395, 400 (Ky. 1975) (\"If upon the consideration of the case a trial judge\\norders a joint trial, we cannot reverse unless we are clearly convinced that\\nprejudice occurred and that the likelihood of prejudice was so clearly\\ndemonstrated to the trial judge as to make his failure to grant severance an\\nabuse of discretion.\").\\n\\nAppellant and Matt did not present antagonistic defenses at trial and the\\ntrial court admonished the jury any time testimony applied only to one of the\\nbrothers. Accordingly, the trial court instructed the jury several times during\\nthe course of the trial that the testimony of various witnesses would be\\nconsidered only for purposes of Matt and had no bearing on Appellant\\'s case.\\nWe have held \"[a] jury is presumed to follow an admonition to disregard\\nevidence and the admonition thus cures any error.\" Johnson v.\\nCommonwealth, 105 S.W.3d 430, 441 (Ky. 2003). The only argument Appellant\\nmakes to this court to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trial\\ncourt\\'s admonitions is that the jury recommended the maximum sentence for\\neach of his charges and recommended that those sentences run consecutively\\nto one another.Appellant points out that Matt was charged with thirteen counts\\nunrelated to the sodomy charge for which both brothers were jointly indicted.\\nHe insists that the testimony solely related to Matt\\'s sexual abuse and use of a\\nminor in a sexual performance charges was often extremely inflammatory.\\nSpecifically, Appellant claims that Matt was tried for an additional indictment\\nof first-degree sodomy \"of a separate child in which [Appellant] was not alleged\\nto have been involved.\" However, this claim is patently false. The only charge\\nof first-degree sodomy against Matt tried jointly with Appellant\\'s case was the\\ncharge for which Appellant was also indicted: in which both Appellant and\\nMatt were charged with sodomizing Appellant\\'s son, Sam.\\n\\n      Relying on our statement in Rearick v. Commonwealth, 858 S.W.2d 185,\\n187 (Ky. 1993), that \"[a] significant factor in identifying such prejudice is the\\nextent to which evidence of one offense would be admissible in a trial of the\\nother offense,\" Appellant argues that because none of the evidence presented\\nagainst Matt in the charges stemming from his second indictment would be\\nadmissible in Appellant\\'s trial, this created sufficient prejudice. However, as\\nstated above (and as Appellant acknowledges), we will not overturn the decision\\nof the trial court absent a showing that it abused its discretion. \"The test for\\nabuse of discretion is whether the trial judge\\'s decision was arbitrary,\\nunreasonable, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles.\"\\nCommonwealth v. English, 993 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Ky. 1999).\\nAs to the brothers\\' sodomy charge, Sam testified in graphic detail about\\nhis father and uncle anally raping him. Sam testified that his father had first\\nsodomized him when he was in first or second grade. He went on to testify that\\nwhen he was in third grade, his father and Matt took turns having sex with\\nhim in the bathroom of the mobile home Sam lived in with his parents and\\nseven siblings. When the Commonwealth asked what he meant by his\\nstatement that Appellant and Matt had sex with him, Sam responded that he\\nmeant that they stuck their penises in his butt. Clearly, so far as the charges\\narising from Appellant and Matt\\'s sodomy of Sam, the brothers were \"alleged to\\nhave participated in the same act or transaction . . . constituting an offense\"\\npursuant to RCr 6.20 and the cases were properly joined under our Rules.\\nAppellant was not prejudiced by the joinder of his and Matt\\'s charges under\\nthis indictment. All of the \"evidence of one offense would be admissible in a\\ntrial of the other offense.\" Rearick, 858 S.W.2d at 187. Therefore, the trial\\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant\\'s motion for severance\\nof the charges included in the same indictment.The charges arising from Matt\\'s separate indictment are a bit more\\nproblematic. Under that indictment, Matt was charged with six counts of first-\\ndegree sexual abuse and seven counts of use of a minor in a sexual\\nperformance. The alleged victims were six of Appellant\\'s children, including\\nSam, and Appellant\\'s step-daughter, Suzie. In addition to Sam and Suzie,\\nthree of Appellant\\'s other children testified about Matt touching them\\ninappropriately, or about seeing Matt touch their siblings or step-sister\\ninappropriately. While the evidence of these other charges would not have\\nbeen admissible in Appellant\\'s trial, we have reviewed the trial record at length\\nand are satisfied with the admonitions the trial court gave the jury. In each\\ninstance, the jury was instructed to only consider the testimony as it related to\\nMatt and not to use it against Appellant in any way. Appellant does not\\nattempt to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trial court\\'s\\nadmonitions.Appellant also complains that a statement a witness (Matt\\'s ex-girlfriend)\\nmade prejudiced him. That witness testified that Matt \"would get around them\\n[(Appellant\\'s children)] and always tell me that he was going to fuck them in the\\nass or make them suck his dick. And he would always say he always wanted a\\nschool boy, he would fuck one eight to eighty.\" The jury was also admonished\\nthat this testimony only concerned Matt and that it was not to use any of this\\nwitness\\'s testimony against Appellant. We note again that \"[a] jury is\\npresumed to follow an admonition to disregard evidence and the admonition\\nthus cures any error.\" Johnson 105 S.W.3d at 441. \"Nor does [Appellant]\\npresent any argument to rebut the presumption that the trial court\\'s\\nadmonition cured the error,\" Mills v. Commonwealth, 996 S.W.2d 473, 485 (Ky.\\n1999) overruled on other grounds by Padgett v. Commonwealth, 312 S.W.3d 336\\n(Ky. 2010). As such, we hold that the trial court\\'s admonitions cured any error\\nresulting from the joinder of Appellant\\'s and Matt\\'s indictments.\\n\\n      Furthermore, Appellant\\'s argument that the evidence should not have\\nbeen admitted, as \"unless a collateral act has some direct relationship to the\\ncharge being tried, its admission necessarily depends on the view that the\\ndefendant\\'s character and predisposition are probative of his guilt,\" Rearick,\\n858 S.W.2d at 187, is without merit. None of the complained of testimony was\\nadmitted against Appellant; but, rather, it was admitted against Matt and the\\njury was specifically directed not to use it in any way against Appellant.\\n\\n      As to Appellant\\'s contention that his sentence reflects the fact that\\nevidence of his brother\\'s crimes prejudiced the jury against him, we point out\\nthat the most inflammatory witness statements in the case would have come in\\nas evidence in Appellant\\'s trial regardless of whether it was joined with his\\nbrother\\'s. In addition to Sam\\'s testimony that his father sodomized him on at\\nleast two occasions in the bathroom of their home, Suzie (who had lived with\\nAppellant since she was around eighteen months old) also testified that\\nAppellant had anally raped her in the same bathroom described by Sam. (This\\ntestimony will be discussed in more detail below.) While the evidence against\\nMatt included testimony by several of the children that he had fondled their\\nbreasts and/or genital areas inside or outside their clothing or exposed himself\\nto the children or had the children disrobe for him, the trial court admonished\\nthe jury not to consider this evidence against Appellant. We believe that the\\nfact that two child witnesses testified that Appellant had anally raped themâ\\x80\\x94\\nand the fact Appellant served as a father figure to both of themâ\\x80\\x94is enough to\\naccount for the jury\\'s recommended sentence without accounting for any\\nalleged prejudice.\\n\\n      We are not \"clearly convinced that prejudice occurred and that the\\nlikelihood of prejudice was so clearly demonstrated to the trial judge as to\\nmake his failure to grant severance an abuse of discretion.\" Rachel, 523\\nS.W.2d at 400. Therefore, we affirm the trial court as to the joinder of\\nAppellant and Matt\\'s trials.\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tB. Other Bad Acts Evidence\\n\\n      Appellant next alleges that the introduction of evidence of Appellant\\'s\\nother bad acts constitutes reversible error. First, Appellant argues that Suzie\\'s\\ntestimony about Appellant sodomizing her should not have been admitted.\\nThis issue was preserved by contemporaneous objection at trial. Appellant also\\nargues that other instances of other bad acts testimony should not have been\\nadmitted at trial, though no objections were made regarding this evidence.\\nThese unobjected-to instances include: Appellant\\'s daughter\\'s testimony that\\nher father had sexually abused her, Sam\\'s testimony that Appellant had\\nphysically abused him, and testimony of Appellant\\'s drug and alcohol use.\\nAppellant argues that the trial court was on notice that such evidence should\\nnot be admitted in spite of his failure to object and that we should treat these\\nerrors as preserved. In the alternative, he requests that we review this\\ntestimony for palpable error.\\n\\nTrue\\tTESTIMONY\\t1. Suzie\\'s Testimony\\n\\n      Kentucky Rules of Evidence 404 deals with character evidence and\\nevidence of other crimes. More specifically, KRE 404(b) provides:\\n      (b) Other crimes, wrongs, or acts. Evidence of other crimes,\\n      wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person      \\n\\t  in order to show action in conformity therewith. It may, however,\\n      be admissible:\\n\\t  \\n           (1) If offered for some other purpose, such as proof of\\n            motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan,\\n            knowledge, identity, or absence of mistake or accident;\\n            or\\n            (2) If so inextricably intertwined with other evidence\\n            essential to the case that separation of the two (2)\\n            could not be accomplished without serious adverse\\n            effect on the offering party.\\n\\nIn Bell v. Commonwealth, 875 S.W.2d 882, 889 (Ky. 1994), this Court stated\\n\"trial courts must apply the rule cautiously, with an eye towards eliminating\\nevidence which is relevant only as proof of an accused\\'s propensity to commit a\\ncertain type of crime.\" We set out a three-prong test that should be followed in\\ndetermining if KRE 404(b) evidence should have been excluded at trial: . (1) the\\nfirst factor goes to relevance and asks, \"[i]s the other crimes evidence relevant\\nfor some purpose other than to prove the criminal disposition of the accused?,\"\\nId.; (2) the second factor goes to probativeness and asks, \"[i]s evidence of the\\nuncharged crime sufficiently probative of its commission by the accused to\\nwarrant its introduction into evidence?,\" Id. at 890; and (3) the third factor goes\\nto prejudice and asks, \"[d]oes the potential for prejudice from the use of other\\ncrimes evidence substantially outweigh its probative value?,\"\\nId. We review a trial court\\'s evidentiary rulings for an abuse of discretion.\\nGoodyear Tire & Rubber Co. v. Thompson, 11 S.W.3d 575, 577 (Ky. 2000).\\n\\n      Before Suzie testified at trial, the jury was instructed that it could\\nconsider the testimony for the limited purpose of Appellant\\'s pattern of\\nconductâ\\x80\\x94and could not consider her testimony for any other purpose. Suzie\\ntestified at trial that Appellant had sex with her. When asked exactly what\\nAppellant did to her, she stated \"[p]ut his penis in my butt. He said that he\\nwas cleaning it.\" Suzie had lived in the same house as Appellant from the time\\nshe was eighteen months old until she was removed from the home at age\\nfourteen. The described abuse happened sometime between the time she was\\ntwelve and fourteen in the same bathroom Sam identified as the location of his\\nabuse. The fact that Appellant had already pled guilty to sexually abusing\\nSuzie and signed a written letter apologizing to her for said abuse was not\\nadmitted at trial. The trial court admitted Suzie\\'s testimony, finding that it was\\nrelevant and admissible as it established a pattern of conduct. Specifically, the\\ntrial court looked at the Bell factors and found:\\n\\n      [Suzie] lived in Appellant\\'s household since the time that she had\\n      any recollection or memory. Appellant was in the role of father to\\n      [Sam] and [Suzie] when the sexual abuse occurred against each.\\n      The sexual abuse occurred in the same house and same bathroom\\n      . . . . [Suzie] described an act of anal penetration that was the\\n      same act to which [Sam] testified.\\n\\nTrue\\tACT\\tC. Precedent Under Federal Communications Acts.\\n\\n      In Pendleton v. Corn., 685 S.W.2d 549, 552 (Ky. 1985), this Court held\\n\"[e]vidence of independent sexual acts between the accused and persons other\\nthan the victim are admissible if such acts are similar to that charged and not\\ntoo remote in time provided the acts are relevant to prove intent, motive or a\\ncommon plan or pattern of activity.\" Appellant argues that Pendleton is\\ndistinguishable from his case for several reasons. First, he argues that the\\nfacts that Suzie and Sam are of different genders and ages, and that Suzie is\\nnot his biological daughter, while Sam is his biological son, make the acts\\ndissimilar. We disagree. The sexual actâ\\x80\\x94anal sodomyâ\\x80\\x94was the same in both\\ninstances. The fact that Suzie happened to be female did not alter the type of\\nsexual act Appellant subjected her to. Sam was likely around eight years old\\nwhen his father and uncle sodomized him, while Suzie was between twelve and\\nfourteen when Appellant sodomized her. We do not believe this approximate\\nfour-year age difference is enough to say that the acts are not of a similar\\nnature. Finally, Appellant was the only father figure Suzie had ever known.\\nShe and Appellant had lived in the same home since she was eighteen months\\nold. As the trial court found, Appellant was a father figure for both Suzie and\\nSam when he sodomized them.\\n\\n      Next, Appellant argues that, under Pendleton, the acts were too remote in\\ntime for Suzie\\'s allegations to be properly admitted at trial. We disagree. When\\nthey testified at trial, Suzie was sixteen years old and Sam was twelve. Suzie\\'s\\nabuse occurred when she was between the ages of twelve and fourteen (or two\\nto four years prior to the trial) and the last time Sam described being\\nsodomized occurred when he was about eight years old (or about four years\\nbefore trial). So, these events occurred at the most two years apart, but\\npossibly even closer in time.\\n\\nTrue\\tSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\t3) Standard Of Review\\n\\n      Under the Bell factors, the trial court had to first determine that the\\nevidence was relevant to prove something apart from Appellant\\'s criminal\\ndisposition before it could admit Suzie\\'s testimony. The trial court found that\\nthe testimony was relevant to show Appellant\\'s pattern of conduct.\\n\\n      The next Bell factor required the trial court to determine if Suzie\\'s\\ntestimony of Appellant\\'s other sexual acts was sufficiently probative and, if so,\\nwhether the probative value was outweighed by undue prejudice. Appellant\\npoints out our language in Driver v. Commonwealth, 361 S.W.3d 877, 885-86\\n(Ky. 2012), that \"prior acts of violence or threats of violence against persons\\nother than the victim in the case on trial have significantly less probative value\\nthan similar prior acts and threats against the same victim.\" He goes on to\\nnote that lain exception has been recognized when the threat against the third\\nperson is so close in time to the charged offense as to be considered a part of\\nthe same transaction.\" Id. at 886 citing Chatt v. Commonwealth, 268 Ky. 141,\\n103 S.W.2d 952, 954-955 (Ky. 1937). However, we emphasize that these were\\nnot threats of violence as contemplated by Driver and Chatt; nor were they\\nunproven allegations of sexual abuse brought up for the first time at trial, as\\nwas the case in Bell. Rather, Suzie\\'s testimony was describing abuse for which\\nAppellant had been previously charged and to which he had already pled guilty\\n(thought this fact was not revealed to the jury). We cannot hold that the trial\\ncourt abused its discretion in allowing the testimony to come in under these\\nfactorsâ\\x80\\x94it was close enough in time and circumstances to be considered part\\nof the same transaction and to show a course of conduct. Moreover, as this\\nCourt held in Commonwealth v. English, 993 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Ky. 1999):\\n      [t]he test of relevancy having been satisfied by proof of a modus\\n      operandi, the evidence of [Appellant\\'s] prior sexual misconduct was\\n      properly admitted unless its probative value was substantially\\n      outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice. KRE 403. This is the\\n      point at which the issue of temporal remoteness becomes a factor\\n      in determining admissibility. Robey v. Commonwealth, Ky., 943\\nS.W.2d 616, 618 (1997). However, it is not the sole determining\\n      factor. While temporal remoteness tends to lessen the probative\\n      value of the evidence of Appellee\\'s prior sexual misconduct, its\\n      probativeness is conversely heightened by the multiplicity of\\n      victims, the multiplicity of occurrences, and the fact that the abuse\\n      was perpetrated against members of several generations of the\\n      same family. Lear v. Commonwealth, Ky., 884 S.W.2d 657 (1994).\\n      The balancing of the probative value of such evidence against the\\n      danger of undue prejudice is a task properly reserved for the sound\\n      discretion of the trial judge. Rake v. Commonwealth, Ky., 450\\nS.W.2d 527, 528 (1970).\\nSee also Jones v. Commonwealth, No. 2002-SC-1011-DG, 2005 WL 635051, at\\n*2 (Ky. Mar. 17, 2005) (\"When the charged crime and the uncharged crime are\\nso similar and so unique as to indicate a reasonable probability that the crimes\\nwere committed by the same person, under the same circumstances, the\\nevidence of the uncharged crime is admissible.\").\\n\\n      Suzie\\'s testimony tended to show that Appellant had a common scheme\\nor pattern of conduct: sodomizing his children in the bathroom of their home.\\nof course this testimony is prejudicial to his caseâ\\x80\\x94just as any adverse\\nevidence is. However, we hold that the trial court did not abuse its discretion\\nin finding that Suzie\\'s testimony was not only probative, but that it was also\\nmore probative than prejudicial. Suzie\\'s testimony was properly admitted for\\nthe limited purpose of showing Appellant\\'s pattern of conduct.\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\t2. Unpreserved Evidentiary Errors\\n\\n      Appellant alleges that, although unobjected to, the remainder of his\\nallegations of error were, in fact, preserved, as the trial court \"was on notice\\nthat such evidence should not be admitted.\" This argument is disingenuous,\\nas Appellant admits that \"his trial counsel inexplicably did not object.\" In fact,\\ntrial counsel failed to object even after the trial court sua sponte asked counsel\\nto approach the bench and raised KRE 404(b) concerns. Even after the trial\\ncourt pointed out that there had been no objection on those grounds,\\nAppellant\\'s trial counsel still failed to make one. Appellant asks, in the\\nalternative, that we review these allegations for palpable error pursuant to RCr\\n10.26. \"Palpable error affects the substantial rights of the party and results in\\nmanifest injustice. Furthermore, an appellant claiming palpable error must\\nshow that the error was more likely than ordinary error to have affected the\\njury.\" Boyd v. Commonwealth, 439 S.W.3d 126, 129-30 (Ky. 2014). \"In\\ndetermining whether an error is palpable, \\'an appellate court must consider\\nwhether on the whole case there is a substantial possibility that the result\\nwould have been any different.\"\\' Commonwealth v. Pace, 82 S.W.3d 894, 895\\n(Ky. 2002) (citing Commonwealth v. McIntosh, 646 S.W.2d 43. 45 (Ky. 1983)).\\nWe will not examine whether any error occurred in these instances, but only, if\\nthere was an error, if it rose to the level of palpable error.\\n\\nTrue\\tTESTIMONY\\ta. Patty\\'s testimony\\n\\n      Appellant\\'s first unpreserved contention arose from the testimony of his\\ndaughter, Patty, who was eight years old at the time of trial. When the\\nCommonwealth asked Patty if she had been sexually abused, she responded in\\nthe affirmative. Then, when the Commonwealth asked Patty who had abused\\nher, she said, \"my dad.\" Appellant did not object, but now complains that he\\nhad no notice under KRE 404(c) that this testimony would be provided and\\nthat it failed to meet the admissibility requirements under the Bell test.\\nThe Commonwealth points out that it did not follow up on Patty\\'s\\nresponse that Appellant had sexually abused her. Rather, it immediately asked\\nPatty if anyone else had sexually abused her and began asking her questions\\nabout Matt. The Commonwealth did nothing to emphasize Patty\\'s statement\\nabout Appellant. We hold that any error in the admission of Patty\\'s testimony\\nwas not \"more likely than ordinary error to have affected the jury.\"    Boyd, 439\\nS.W.3d at 129-30 (Ky. 2014). Furthermore, considering the other evidence\\npresented against Appellant, there is no \"substantial possibility that the result\\nwould have been any different\" in the absence of any such error.       Pace, 82\\nS.W.3d at 895.\\n\\nTrue\\tTESTIMONY\\t b. Sam\\'s testimony of physical abuse\\n\\n      During Sam\\'s testimony, he recounted an event during which Appellant\\nslammed his head into the bathroom wall, leaving a hole visible in pictures he\\nand Suzie were shown to identify the bathroom in which Appellant sodomized\\nthem. When the Commonwealth asked Sam about this event, the trial court\\nasked counsel to approach the bench and expressed concerns about KRE\\n404(b). Appellant\\'s counsel\\'s only remark was that he did not \"have notice of\\n404(c).\" Appellant never objected to the line of questioning. The trial judge\\ninformed the Commonwealth that if these claims could be related to the\\ncharges, that would be fine, but, \"just general evidence about these are bad\\npeople despite the lack of objection, I am not going to allow that.\" (Emphasis\\nadded.)The Commonwealth argues that this testimony should have come in to\\navoid any unanimous verdict issues. There is no need for us to address that\\ncontention, because, due to the lack of objectionâ\\x80\\x94even though the trial court\\nindicated that it may be a concernâ\\x80\\x94we will review only for palpable error. Sam\\ntestified in depth about what Appellant did to him sexually. There is no\\nsubstantial possibility that a manifest injustice occurred such that the result -\\nin the case would have been any different absent testimony of physical abuse.\\nTherefore, we hold that there was no palpable error.\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tc. Drug and Alcohol Use\\n\\n      Again, Appellant raised no objection to any admission of testimony that\\nhe drank, used drugs, or was unemployed. Much of the testimony regarding\\nhis alcohol use was when the children were \"setting the scene\" for the events\\nsurrounding their abuse. The testimony concerning his unemployment only\\ncame up when a witness testified that he stayed home with the kids. Due to\\nthe testimonial evidence the jury heard from Sam and Suzie concerning being\\nsodomized by Appellant, there is no substantial possibility that a manifest\\ninjustice occurred such that the result in the case would have been any\\ndifferent absent testimony of physical abuse. Therefore, we hold that there was\\nno palpable error.\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tC. Sentence\\n\\n      The jury recommended that Appellant be sentenced to life imprisonment\\nfor sodomy, fifty years\\' imprisonment for incest, and twenty years\\'\\nimprisonment for use of a minor in a sexual performance. The judgment is\\nsilent as to whether the sentences are to run concurrently or consecutively.\\nAppellant claims that the trial court erred in ordering that his life sentence be\\nrun consecutively to a twenty year sentence he was already in the process of\\nserving. He points out that this ruling was made orally, but that the\\nsentencing order failed to reflect whether the sentences were to be run\\nconcurrently or consecutively.\\n\\n      As the Commonwealth points out, the sentences must be served\\nconcurrently pursuant to KRS 532.110, which provides:\\n       (2) If the court does not specify the manner in which a sentence\\n      imposed by it is to run, the sentence shall run concurrently with\\n      any other sentence which the defendant must serve unless the\\n      sentence is required by subsection (3) of this section or KRS\\n      533.060 to run consecutively.\\nWhile the trial court did orally rule from the bench that Appellant\\'s life\\nsentence should be served consecutively to the twenty-year sentence he had\\nalready begun serving (and even indicated he would like a ruling from this\\nCourt on the issue), the written order did not reflect this. In fact, the order did\\nnot refer to Appellant\\'s twenty-year sentence at all. \"[T]he rule in Kentucky is\\nthat when there is an inconsistency between oral statements of the presiding\\njudge and an order or judgment reduced to writing, the written order or\\njudgment prevails.\"    Cardwell v. Commonwealth, 12 S.W.3d 672, 678 (Ky.\\n2000), citing RCr 13.04; CR 54.01; Commonwealth v. Taber, Ky., 941 S.W.2d\\n463, 464 (1997); Commonwealth v. Hicks, Ky., 869 S.W.2d 35, 37-38 (1994).\\n\\n      Appellant\\'s sentence, as pronounced in the written sentencing order,\\ncomports with the law. There is no relief to be granted upon this issue and we\\nwill not address it further.\\n\\nTrue\\tCONCLUSION\\t                                III. CONCLUSION\\n\\n      For the foregoing reasons, we affirm Appellant\\'s convictions and\\nsentence.Minton, C.J., Abramson, Barber, Cunningham, Keller, and Noble, JJ.,\\nconcur. Venters, J., dissents by separate opinion.VENTERS, J., DISSENTS: I respectfully dissent because I believe that\\nAppellant\\'s trial on three counts involving a single victim should not have been\\njoined for trial with the multitude of charges against his brother, Matt,\\ninvolving seventeen crimes against seven different\\' victims. The majority\\nconcedes that much of the evidence presented against Matt would have been\\ninadmissible in a trial against Appellant.\\nThe fact that Appellant was being tried alongside his brother does not\\nrender such evidence admissible against Appellant; in fact, the association of\\nAppellant at trial with his brother on the unrelated crimes enhanced the\\nprejudicial effect of the improper evidence. I do not believe any trial judge\\ncould fashion an admonition to the jury sufficient to remove that taint.\\nIntroducing such prejudicial evidence and telling the jury not to consider it was\\nlike throwing hot pepper into the stew and telling the jury not to taste it. I\\nbelieve Appellant\\'s conviction should be reversed.\\n\\n\\n\\nCOUNSEL FOR APPELLANT:\\nJason Apollo Hart, Assistant Public Advocate\\nCOUNSEL FOR APPELLEE:\\nJack Conway, Attorney General of Kentucky\\nJames Hays Lawson, Assistant Attorney General\\n\\nTrue\\tBACKGROUND\\tI. BACKGROUND\\n\\nTrue\\tSTATEMENT OF FACTS\\tA. Substantive Facts\\n\\n       On February 17, 2001, Kenneth Flowers (Flowers) was murdered by a man who has never\\nbeen identified. The shooter asked Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s brother if he was Flowers, and when the brother said\\nno, the shooter departed. Soon the shooter returned, asked Flowers â\\x80\\x9cWhatâ\\x80\\x99s up?â\\x80\\x9d and fatally shot\\nFlowers. R. 16 (06/16/03 Trial Tr., Dequan Flowers at 159â\\x80\\x9361). Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s mother, Emma Flowers,\\nand her neighbor, Lucretia Adams (Adams), told an officer that they suspected Willie James Jones,\\nwhom they knew by the nickname â\\x80\\x9cNookie.â\\x80\\x9dMcLister Trice was the link between Flowers and Jones. She had dated and had a child with\\nJones, and dated Flowers from October 2000 to January 2001. After breaking up with Flowers three\\nweeks before the murder, Trice filed several police reports about Flowers vandalizing her car and\\nstalking her. She also obtained a personal protective order against him. Tensions escalated in early\\nFebruary 2001, when Flowers followed Trice into a liquor store. Jones was with Trice, and an\\nargument ensued. Flowers struck Triceâ\\x80\\x99s head, and in return Trice hit Flowers with a wine bottle.\\nFlowers ran from the store and told his companion, Jeff Adams, that Flowers had punched Jones and\\nthat Jones had a gun. Jeff Adams testified to these facts, though he had not witnessed the fight.\\nTrice, however, insisted that Jones was not involved and did not have a gun.Around 10 a.m. on the morning of the shooting, Trice drove to the home of her stepmother,Patricia Wilson. Flowers, who lived across the street, approached Triceâ\\x80\\x99s car and punched her\\nwindow. Adams testified that she overheard Trice tell Flowers â\\x80\\x9cB----, you going to die today. Nook\\n-- my baby daddy Nook is setting it up now.â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03 Trial Tr., Adams at 113). Emma\\nFlowersâ\\x80\\x99s testimony was substantially similar. Id. (E. Flowers at 132) (â\\x80\\x9câ\\x80\\x98B----, you going to die\\ntoday. My baby daddy Nook is out making arrangements for you to be killed.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d). Trice denied\\nmaking these statements, and Jones denied telling Trice that he planned to kill Flowers.\\n\\n       Afterward, Trice called her stepmother, Patricia Wilson. Wilson later testified that Trice told\\nher about the incident with Flowers and â\\x80\\x9cthat Nook was going to take care of it that day.â\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n(Wilson at 103).Around noon, Jones stopped by Triceâ\\x80\\x99s workplace. Trice told Jones and other people about\\nthe encounter with Flowers. Around 4 p.m., Jones called Trice to say that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been\\ntaken care of.â\\x80\\x9d Id. (Trice at 40). Trice responded â\\x80\\x9c[d]onâ\\x80\\x99t go over there bothering him,â\\x80\\x9d but Jones\\nsaid â\\x80\\x9cI paid the n-----.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 40, 45. Three hours later and after the shooting, Jones visited Trice\\nat work again. Trice asked Jones whether he had â\\x80\\x9canything to do with it.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 44. Jones seemed\\nto be drinking and his response was ambiguous: â\\x80\\x9c[w]hat you thought.â\\x80\\x9d Id.\\n\\nTrue\\tPROCEDURE\\t\\tB. Procedure\\n\\n       Before Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s trial, the trial court excluded testimony from Emma Flowers and Adams about\\nTriceâ\\x80\\x99s statement (â\\x80\\x9cyou going to die today; Nook is setting it up nowâ\\x80\\x9d) because it appeared to be\\ndouble hearsay, lack foundation, and might fall outside of Michiganâ\\x80\\x99s then-existing state-of-mind\\nexception to the hearsay prohibition. The trial court withheld judgment on whether the evidence\\ncould be introduced to impeach Trice. The court also excluded Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s testimony that Trice had\\ntold her that Jones would take care of Triceâ\\x80\\x99s problem with Flowers.\\n\\n       The evidentiary issue reemerged at trial. On direct examination, Trice could not recall the\\ntime at which she spoke to Jones. The government referenced a statement that Trice had given to\\npolice after the shooting when she had been arrested for her own alleged involvement. The\\ngovernment offered the statement to Trice to refresh her recollection. Trice then testified that, at 4\\np.m., Jones had said â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been taken care ofâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c[h]e already paid someone.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at\\n40. The government asked whether Trice had said anything to Flowers that morning, but the judge\\nsent the jury away before Trice answered. The judge informed the governmentâ\\x80\\x99s counsel that it\\nwould not permit questioning on an irrelevant point as a means of creating an innocuous\\ninconsistency from which to introduce Emma Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s and Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s statements â\\x80\\x9cunder the guise\\nof impeachment.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 47. The judge then cautioned the defense attorney to constrain her\\nquestions to avoid â\\x80\\x9copen[ing] the door for the admission . . . of the heretofore barred . . . statements.â\\x80\\x9d\\nId. at 56â\\x80\\x9357.On cross-examination, Trice claimed that she did not know what Jones was talking about\\nwhen he mentioned paying someone to take care of an order. Defense counsel also asked a series\\nof questions to undermine the credibility of Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statement to the police: she had been arrested,\\nwas poorly treated, did not write the statement herself, and signed it while scared, threatened, and\\nhungry. Based on this latter set of questions, the trial court ruled that defense counsel had opened\\nthe door to the hearsay statements, permitting the government to rehabilitate Trice with her\\nconsistent, pre-arrest statements. Wilson, Emma Flowers, and Adams testified to the statements\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat Nook was going to take care of it that day,â\\x80\\x9d id. (Wilson at 103), and â\\x80\\x9c[b]----, you going to die\\ntoday. Nook -- my baby daddy Nook is setting it up now,â\\x80\\x9d id. (Adams at 113); see also id. (E.\\nFlowers at 132). Defense counsel objected specifically to Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s testimony but the judge admitted\\nit both as a prior consistent statement and for impeachment. The attorney did not request a limiting\\ninstruction.\\n\\nThe jury convicted Jones of second-degree murder, conspiracy to commit first-degree\\nmurder, and solicitation of first-degree murder. He is serving concurrent sentences of life\\nimprisonment for conspiracy, nineteen-to-thirty years of imprisonment for second-degree murder,\\nand nineteen-to-thirty years of imprisonment for solicitation of first-degree murder. The Michigan\\nCourt of Appeals affirmed the convictions, People v. Jones, No. 250326, 2005 WL 657578 (Mich.\\nCt. App. March 22, 2005) (unpublished opinion), and the Michigan Supreme Court declined leave\\nto appeal. Following his direct appeal, Jones filed his habeas petition with the district court. The\\ndistrict court denied relief but granted a certificate of appealability on the three issues that are now\\nbefore this court: ineffective assistance of trial counsel, multiple punishments in violation of the\\nDouble Jeopardy Clause, and sufficiency of the evidence. Jones v. Harry, No. 06-13465, 2009 WL\\n275728 (E.D. Mich. 2009) (unpublished opinion).\\n\\nTrue\\tANALYSIS\\tII. ANALYSIS\\n\\t\\nTrue\\tSTANDARD OF REVIEW\\tA. Standard of Review\\n\\n       â\\x80\\x9cIn a habeas corpus proceeding, this Court reviews a district courtâ\\x80\\x99s legal conclusions de\\nnovo and its factual findings for clear error.â\\x80\\x9d Goff v. Bagley, 601 F.3d 445, 455 (6th Cir. 2010)\\n(quotation omitted).\\n\\n       Michigan state courts adjudicated the merits of Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s claims, and the Antiterrorism and\\nEffective Death Penalty Act (AEDPA) applies. As a result, we can afford relief on the ineffective-\\nassistance and double-jeopardy claims only if the Michigan decision was â\\x80\\x9ccontrary to, or involved\\nan unreasonable application of, clearly established Federal law, as determined by the Supreme Court\\nof the United States.â\\x80\\x9d 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2254(d)(1). As to the sufficiency of the evidence, we review the\\nMichigan decision to see if it was â\\x80\\x9cbased on an unreasonable determination of the facts in light of\\nthe evidence presented in the State court proceeding.â\\x80\\x9d 28 U.S.C. Â§ 2254(d)(2).\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tB. Ineffective Assistance of Counsel\\n\\n       Jones challenges the assistance of his trial counsel on two bases. First, he asserts that his\\nattorney provided ineffective assistance by opening the door for Triceâ\\x80\\x99s prior statements to come into\\nevidence by discrediting Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statement to the police, even though her statement to the police was\\nnot actually admitted into evidence. Second, he complains that his attorney did not request that the\\njudge instruct the jury to consider Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s, Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s, and Emma Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s testimony only for its\\nimpeachment value. To succeed on his ineffective-assistance claim, Jones must show that the state\\ncourts unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), which requires both deficient performance and prejudice to the defense. Attorney performance is deficient if\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccounselâ\\x80\\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonablenessâ\\x80\\x9d by making â\\x80\\x9cerrors so\\nserious that counsel was not functioning as the â\\x80\\x98counselâ\\x80\\x99 guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment.â\\x80\\x9d\\nId. at 687â\\x80\\x9388. â\\x80\\x9cOur review of counselâ\\x80\\x99s performance is highly deferential and counsel is strongly\\npresumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of\\nreasonable professional judgment.â\\x80\\x9d Johnson v. Bell, 525 F.3d 466, 487 (6th Cir. 2008) (internal\\nquotation marks omitted).\\n\\nTrue\\tJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\\t1. Opening the Door For Prejudicial Hearsay\\n\\n       Opening the door to damaging testimony can constitute deficient performance. See, e.g.,\\nWhite v. Thaler, 610 F.3d 890, 900 (5th Cir. 2010). Here, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals\\nfound that opening the door was a necessary consequence of the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s much-needed attack on\\nTriceâ\\x80\\x99s credibility. That consequence was damaging, but we consider it in context, alongside the\\nbeneficial results of the strategy and in light of counselâ\\x80\\x99s slim options. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539\\nU.S. 510, 523 (2003) (using â\\x80\\x9ca context-dependent consideration of the challenged [attorney] conductâ\\x80\\x9d).On direct examination, Trice had testified to Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s statements that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been\\ntaken care of,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c[h]e already paid someone,â\\x80\\x9d and he had done â\\x80\\x9c[w]hat you thought.â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03\\nTrial Tr., Trice at 40, 44). Although Triceâ\\x80\\x99s police statement had not been admitted into evidence,\\nthe jury was aware of her statement to police because the prosecution had referenced it when\\nrefreshing Triceâ\\x80\\x99s recollection. Jones admits that direct examination implied that the police report\\nwas consistent with Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statements. Doing nothing to counter these damaging claims and\\nimplications on cross-examination would not have been a wise choice, despite what Jones argues\\nnow. The Michigan Court of Appeals did not unreasonably determine that, â\\x80\\x9c[b]ecause of the nature\\nof [Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statements on direct], defense counsel would have been remiss not to address the\\nstatements on cross-examination and attempt to explain them.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578, at *3.\\n\\n       Debunking the police report removed any enhanced credibility that the police report had\\nadded to Triceâ\\x80\\x99s testimony. Jones argues that his attorney performed deficiently because she acted\\non the false belief that the police report was in evidence. But his attorney explicitly confirmed her\\nunderstanding that the statement was not in evidence. R. 17 at 79 (â\\x80\\x9cTHE COURT: â\\x80\\x98You know, her\\nstatement is actually not in evidence, [defense counsel]. Her trial testimony is.â\\x80\\x99 [DEFENSE\\nCOUNSEL]: â\\x80\\x98I understand.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d). Defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s cross-examination was directed at â\\x80\\x9cwhat the\\nprosecutor said when he was asking [Trice] questions. He asked about her [police] statement, what\\nshe said in her statement.â\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nSome portions of the cross-examination strategy did not depend on the police report. For\\nexample, the defense attorney extracted from Trice that she did not know what Jones was talking\\nabout when he referenced the order that he had taken care of or when he said that he had paid\\nsomeone. The judge had warned the defense attorney about the risk of opening the door to\\npreviously excluded testimony. In hindsight, perhaps refraining from asking about the police report\\nwould have been a better strategy. But given the deference with which we review attorney decisions,\\nwe cannot say that the state courts were unreasonable in concluding that the choice was not\\nconstitutionally deficient. The circumstances of the police reportâ\\x80\\x94Triceâ\\x80\\x99s own arrest as well as her\\nmaltreatmentâ\\x80\\x94make her statements dubious. That line of questioning may have had more force than\\ndid Triceâ\\x80\\x99s admission that she felt that Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s statements were ambiguous. Also, each of the\\nhearsay statements relies on Triceâ\\x80\\x99s credibility as a declarant. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s trial counsel reasonably might\\nhave decided that the benefit of casting doubt on Triceâ\\x80\\x99s testimony outweighed the harm of new\\nwitnesses testifying to statements similar to what that the jury had already heard.\\n\\n       The Michigan Court of Appeals held that â\\x80\\x9c[c]ounselâ\\x80\\x99s strategy was clearly to try to show that\\nTrice did not know what defendant meant by the statements. Given counselâ\\x80\\x99s limited options, this\\nstrategy was not unsound.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578, at *3. The attorneyâ\\x80\\x99s strategy was somewhat\\nbroader in that it probed the circumstances of the police report, but the state court was not\\nunreasonable in determining that the attorney exercised professional judgment and provided\\nconstitutionally adequate assistance. Thus, Jones cannot demonstrate ineffective assistance of\\ncounsel.\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\t2. Failing to Request A Limiting Instruction\\n\\n       Although Jones briefs the issue on appeal, his habeas petition does not allege that trial\\ncounselâ\\x80\\x99s performance was deficient for failing to request a limiting instruction for the testimony of\\nWilson, Emma Flowers, or Adams. While the claim bears some resemblance to his first ineffective-\\nassistance claim, his petition did not fairly raise the issue of limiting instructions. We therefore may\\nnot review the claim. See Seymour v. Walker, 224 F.3d 542, 561 (6th Cir. 2000), cert. denied, 532\\nU.S. 989 (2001).\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tC. Double Jeopardy\\n\\n       The Fifth Amendment ensures that no one may â\\x80\\x9cbe subject for the same offence to be twice\\nput in jeopardy of life or limb.â\\x80\\x9d U.S. CONST . amend. V. That clause protects criminal defendants\\nfrom prosecution following conviction or acquittal for the same offense, and also prohibits infliction\\nof â\\x80\\x9cmultiple punishments for the same offense imposed in a single proceeding.â\\x80\\x9d Jones v. Thomas,\\n491 U.S. 376, 381 (1989) (internal quotation marks omitted). â\\x80\\x9cWith respect to cumulative sentences imposed in a single trial, the Double Jeopardy Clause does no more than prevent the sentencing court\\nfrom prescribing greater punishment than the legislature intended.â\\x80\\x9d Missouri v. Hunter, 459 U.S.\\n359, 366 (1983). In fact, â\\x80\\x9cthe Court has never held or intimated that the constitutional bar against\\ndouble jeopardy circumscribes the legislative prerogative to define crimes and prescribe punishment\\nin the context of a single prosecution.â\\x80\\x9d White v. Howes, 586 F.3d 1025, 1032 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 3370 (2010). â\\x80\\x9cEven if the crimes are the same under Blockburger [v. United\\nStates, 284 U.S. 299 (1932)], if it is evident that a state legislature intended to authorize cumulative\\npunishments, a courtâ\\x80\\x99s inquiry is at an end.â\\x80\\x9d Ohio v. Johnson, 467 U.S. 493, 499 n.8 (1984); see also\\nWhite, 586 F.3d at 1032 (denying habeas even though the panel â\\x80\\x9cagree[d] . . . that the two statutes\\nat issue . . . punish the same offense under Blockburgerâ\\x80\\x9d).We owe the Michigan courts deference even if, as seems to be the case, Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s appeal was the first time that they ruled on the issue. Because â\\x80\\x9cthe only question for the [Michigan] Court of\\nAppeals was what the legislature had intended,â\\x80\\x9d any error in its reasoning â\\x80\\x9cis purely a matter of state\\nlaw.â\\x80\\x9d McCloud v. Deppisch, 409 F.3d 869, 874 (7th Cir.), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1063 (2005); see\\nalso Banner v. Davis, 886 F.2d 777, 782 (6th Cir. 1989) (holding that we may not â\\x80\\x9cindependently\\nevaluate the scope of the Tennessee statutes here, the Tennessee Court of Criminal Appeals and\\n[Tennessee] Supreme Court having already held that the legislature intended cumulative\\npunishmentsâ\\x80\\x9d).1 â\\x80\\x9c[T]he fact that the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s interpretation of state law happens to be central\\nJones points to language in Banner limiting its relevance when the state courts â\\x80\\x9cfailed to\\ngive a clear expression on the issue of cumulative punishment.â\\x80\\x9d Banner, 886 F.2d at 782. Banner\\nused that language to distinguish Pryor v. Rose, 724 F.2d 525 (6th Cir. 1984) (en banc), an opinion\\nto the double jeopardy analysis does not permit us to review the [Michigan] Court of Appealsâ\\x80\\x99\\nconstruction of [its own] law.â\\x80\\x9d McCloud, 409 F.3d at 875. It does not matter, as Jones argues, that\\nthe state appellate decision was not precedential or that only a stateâ\\x80\\x99s supreme court can issue a\\nbinding interpretation of state law. The state courtâ\\x80\\x99s decision of state law is not cognizable on\\nhabeas review.\\n\\n       Jones cites Brown v. Ohio, 432 U.S. 161 (1977), as an example of the Supreme Court reviewing the state courtâ\\x80\\x99s reasoning on a double jeopardy claim. In that case, the Court said that\\nit â\\x80\\x9cagree[d] with the Ohio Court of Appeals that joyriding and auto theft, as defined by the [state]\\ncourt, constitute the same statutory offense within the meaning of the Double Jeopardy Clause.â\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nat 168. Put differently, the Court agreed that, given the lack of legislative authorization for multiple\\npunishments, the convictions in Brown violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.A multiple-\\npunishments challenge takes root only if the legislature did not authorize multiple punishments.\\nWhen it has, there is no federal issue with which a federal court can agree or disagree. See Banner,\\n886 F.2d at 782 (rejecting the reading of Brown advocated by Jones).In this case, we must accept the Michigan Court of Appealsâ\\x80\\x99 construction of the Michigan statutes: the murder statute â\\x80\\x9cprotect[s] human life and prohibit[s] wrongful slayingsâ\\x80\\x9d; the conspiracy\\nstatute â\\x80\\x9cprotect[s] society from the increased danger presented by group activityâ\\x80\\x9d; and the solicitation\\nthat did not make clear howâ\\x80\\x94or whetherâ\\x80\\x94the state court had decided the double-jeopardy question.\\nBanner, 886 F.2d at 782 & n.2. The Banner panel resolved the confusion by holding that we must\\ndefer to state-court holdings when the state â\\x80\\x9ccourts have carefully considered and analyzed the scope\\nof the [state] statutes.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at 782. The Michigan Court of Appeals did so in this case, and we are\\nbound by Banner.\\nstatute â\\x80\\x9cpr[o]scribe[s] the inducement of another to commit an offense.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578,\\nat *5. A federal court reviewing a habeas petition may not, as Jones requests, reexamine the role of\\nMichiganâ\\x80\\x99s rule of lenity, the level of generality at which to examine the purpose of each statute, or\\nwhether Michiganâ\\x80\\x99s legislature intended to punish a single act of procurement under three statutes.\\nGiven the distinct purposes of the statutes of conviction, there is no colorable argument that the\\nDouble Jeopardy Clause protects Jones from being convicted under all three statutes.\\n\\nTrue\\tDK\\tD. Sufficiency of the Evidence\\n\\n       Under AEDPA, challenges to the sufficiency of the evidence used to convict a petitioner\\nmust survive â\\x80\\x9ctwo layers of deference to groups who might view facts differently than we would.â\\x80\\x9d\\nBrown v. Konteh, 567 F.3d 191, 205 (6th Cir. 2009), cert. denied, 130 S. Ct. 1081 (2010).\\nId. (citations omitted). Jones challenges each of his three convictions, but he disputes the sufficiency\\nof the evidence only as to (1) his intent and (2) his performance of acts that assisted in or his\\nencouragement of the murder. Sufficient evidence supports both elements.\\n\\nTrue\\tACT\\tC. Precedent Under Federal Communications Acts.\\n\\n        One element of second-degree murder is the â\\x80\\x9cintent to kill, . . . inflict great bodily harm, or\\n. . . create a very high risk of death with the knowledge that the act probably will cause death or great\\nbodily harm.â\\x80\\x9d People v. Bailey, 549 N.W.2d 325, 331 (Mich. 1996). Under an aiding-and-abetting\\ntheory of liability, the intent component is satisfied by, among other options, proof that â\\x80\\x9cthe\\ndefendant intended the commission of the crime.â\\x80\\x9d People v. Robinson, 715 N.W.2d 44, 47â\\x80\\x9348\\n(Mich. 2006) (internal quotation and alteration marks removed). â\\x80\\x9c[I]nten[t] that a murder would in\\nfact be committedâ\\x80\\x9d is also an element of solicitation to commit murder. People v. Crawford, 591\\nN.W.2d 669, 673 (Mich. Ct. App. 1998). Similarly, conspiracy requires specific intent â\\x80\\x9cto combine\\nwith othersâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9cto accomplish the illegal objective.â\\x80\\x9d People v. Carter, 330 N.W.2d 314, 319\\n(Mich. 1982), overruled in part on other grounds, People v. Robideau, 55 N.W.2d 592 (Mich. 1984).\\nIn this case, a jury could reasonably find that Jones intended to have the victim killed and intended\\nto make an agreement to kill the victim. Adams and Emma Flowers both testified that, based on the\\nstatement that they overheard Trice make, Jones was arranging to have the victim killed. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s\\nstatements to Triceâ\\x80\\x94that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been taken care of,â\\x80\\x9d that he had â\\x80\\x9cpaid the n-----,â\\x80\\x9d and,\\nwhen asked â\\x80\\x9cwhether he had anything to do withâ\\x80\\x9d the victimâ\\x80\\x99s death, he responded â\\x80\\x9c[w]hat you\\nthought,â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03 Trial Tr., Trice at 40, 42â\\x80\\x9345)â\\x80\\x94could be interpreted as evidence of intent.\\nThe liquor-store conflict and Triceâ\\x80\\x99s difficulties with the victim also supply limited circumstantial\\nsupport. Resolving factual disputes in favor of the prosecution, we cannot conclude that it was\\nunreasonable for the Michigan Court of Appeals to determine that a rational trier of fact could find\\nthat Jones had intended to kill Flowers.\\n\\nTrue\\tACT\\tB. The Pole Attachment Act.\\n\\n       For similar reasons, the Michigan Court of Appeals was not unreasonable in finding that\\nJones performed acts or gave encouragement to the shooter, as is required under an aiding-and-\\nabetting theory, Robinson, 715 N.W.2d at 47â\\x80\\x9348, and that Jones made an agreement to commit\\nmurder, which is required for a conspiracy conviction, Carter, 330 N.W.2d at 319.

The written grant of immunity proffered by the\\nState, titled \"GRANT OF USE IMMUNITY,\" stated:\\n               \"COMES NOW the Plaintiff, State of Kansas, by and through Reno County\\n       District Attorney of the 27th Judicial District, Keith E.

       " '       In the interim, the United States Attorney for the District of Kansas, Barry R.\\nGrissom, sent a letter to the district attorney stating that Grissom was familiar with the\\nfacts surrounding Delacruz\\' case and that while the letter did not act as a \"formal grant of\\nimmunity,\" no federal prosecution against Delacruz was warranted or would be\\nforthcoming for his involvement in the murder of Haines.

But \"the power to compel testimony is not\\nabsolute,\" and the most important exception to that power is the Fifth Amendment\\nprivilege against compulsory self-incrimination. Kastigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441,\\n444, 92 S. Ct. 1653, 32 L. Ed. 2d 212 (1972).

The privilege afforded not only applies to a witness\\' answers\\nthat would directly support a criminal conviction but also embraces those answers which\\nwould furnish a link in the chain of evidence needed to prosecute the claimant for a\\ncrime.

       " \"       On the other hand, a witness who has no reasonable cause to fear incrimination\\ncannot invoke the right. Hoffman, 341 U.S. at 486. One manner in which the State can\\nremove the fear of incrimination and compel testimony is to grant the witness immunity\\nin return for the witness' testimony. But not all grants of immunity will satisfy the\\nconstraints of the right against self-incrimination. As our Court of Appeals noted over\\ntwo decades ago:\",\n",
       " '               \"\\'There are three recognized types of immunity: (1) \"transactional,\" (2) \"use and\\n       derivative use,\" and, (3) \"use.\" \"Transactional\" immunity protects the witness from\\n       prosecution for offenses to which the compelled testimony relates. This type of immunity\\n       is broader than the constitutional privilege against self-incrimination and need not always\\n       be granted, although it does, of course, constitute adequate immunity. \"Use and\\n       derivative use\" immunity protects the witness from the use of compelled testimony and\\n       evidence derived therefrom. It is coextensive with the constitutional privilege against\\n       self-incrimination and is therefore a sufficient grant of immunity to compel self-\\n       incriminatory testimony. On the other hand, mere \"use\" immunity, which only prevents\\n       the prosecution from using the compelled testimony in any criminal proceeding, is not\\n       constitutionally adequate since it does not prevent prosecuting authorities from making\\n       derivative use of the fruits of a witness\\' compelled testimony by obtaining investigatory\\n       leads from it.\\'\" Cabral v. State, 19 Kan. App. 2d 456, 460-61, 871 P.2d 1285 (1994).\\n       Cabral cited to this court\\'s prior decision in State v. Durrant, 244 Kan. 522, 534,\\n769 P.2d 1174 (1989), which held:\\n       \"For a statutory grant of immunity to be coextensive with the privilege against self-\\n       incrimination, it must grant not only use immunity, or protection from the direct use of\\n       compelled incriminatory information, but also derivative-use immunity, which prohibits\\n       use of any such information for investigatory purposes leading to other evidence of\\n       criminal activity.\"',\n",
       " 'Durrant was consistent with the landmark case of Kastigar, which, as noted above, held\\nthat if the government wants to compel testimony from a witness claiming the Fifth\\nAmendment privilege against compulsory self-incrimination, it must grant the witness at\\nleast use and derivative use immunity, otherwise a citation in contempt must be reversed.\\nHere, the State expressly granted Delacruz mere use immunity. To reiterate, the\\nwritten document provided to Delacruz was entitled, \"GRANT OF USE IMMUNITY,\"\\nand stated in the body that Delacruz was being granted \"immunity from the use of any\\ntestimony given in the above-captioned matter on February 28, 2011 through March 9,\\n2011.\" The document went on to explain that the use immunity being granted meant that\\nDelacruz\\' testimony would not be used against him in any potential future case. The\\ndocument did not mention the use of any evidence that might be derived from the\\ncompelled testimony. As Kastigar explained, the derivative use component of a\\ncoextensive grant of immunity is important because it \"[bars] the use of any evidence\\nobtained by focusing investigation on a witness as a result of his compelled disclosures.\"\\n406 U.S. at 460. The State\\'s grant of immunity to Delacruz plainly did not include this\\nimportant component.',\n",
       " '       Curiously, the grant of immunity document refers to the statute dealing with\\nimmunities, K.S.A. 22-3415, which specifically refers to use and derivative use immunity\\nunder subsection (b)(2). But the immunity document does not purport to incorporate that\\nstatutory definition by reference; rather, it recites that the immunity is being granted\\n\"pursuant to the authority vested in me as District Attorney, by K.S.A. 22-3415(a) [and]\\n(c).\" Those subsections, (a) and (c), have nothing to do with the type of immunity being\\ngranted. In other words, no reasonable inference on the type of immunity being granted\\ncan be discerned from the statutory reference.',\n",
       " \"       To summarize, the State granted Delacruz use immunity; the use immunity\\ngranted was not coextensive with Delacruz' constitutional right against self-incrimination;\\ntherefore, Judge Chambers' order compelling Delacruz' testimony at the Waller trial\\nviolated Delacruz' constitutional right against self-incrimination and was unlawful.\\nConsequently, Judge McCarville's ensuing order, finding Delacruz in direct contempt of\\ncourt for refusing to testify and sentencing him to a consecutive 108-month prison term,\\nwas likewise unlawful.\",\n",

The only argument Appellant\\nmakes to this court to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trial\\ncourt\\'s admonitions is that the jury recommended the maximum sentence for\\neach of his charges and recommended that those sentences run consecutively\\nto one another.Appellant points out that Matt was charged with thirteen counts\\nunrelated to the sodomy charge for which both brothers were jointly indicted.\\nHe insists that the testimony solely related to Matt\\'s sexual abuse and use of a\\nminor in a sexual performance charges was often extremely inflammatory.\\nSpecifically, Appellant claims that Matt was tried for an additional indictment\\nof first-degree sodomy \"of a separate child in which [Appellant] was not alleged\\nto have been involved.\" However, this claim is patently false. The only charge\\nof first-degree sodomy against Matt tried jointly with Appellant\\'s case was the\\ncharge for which Appellant was also indicted: in which both Appellant and\\nMatt were charged with sodomizing Appellant\\'s son, Sam.',\n",
       " '      Relying on our statement in Rearick v. Commonwealth, 858 S.W.2d 185,\\n187 (Ky. 1993), that \"[a] significant factor in identifying such prejudice is the\\nextent to which evidence of one offense would be admissible in a trial of the\\nother offense,\" Appellant argues that because none of the evidence presented\\nagainst Matt in the charges stemming from his second indictment would be\\nadmissible in Appellant\\'s trial, this created sufficient prejudice. However, as\\nstated above (and as Appellant acknowledges), we will not overturn the decision\\nof the trial court absent a showing that it abused its discretion. \"The test for\\nabuse of discretion is whether the trial judge\\'s decision was arbitrary,\\nunreasonable, unfair, or unsupported by sound legal principles.\"\\nCommonwealth v. English, 993 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Ky. 1999).\\nAs to the brothers\\' sodomy charge, Sam testified in graphic detail about\\nhis father and uncle anally raping him. Sam testified that his father had first\\nsodomized him when he was in first or second grade. He went on to testify that\\nwhen he was in third grade, his father and Matt took turns having sex with\\nhim in the bathroom of the mobile home Sam lived in with his parents and\\nseven siblings. When the Commonwealth asked what he meant by his\\nstatement that Appellant and Matt had sex with him, Sam responded that he\\nmeant that they stuck their penises in his butt. Clearly, so far as the charges\\narising from Appellant and Matt\\'s sodomy of Sam, the brothers were \"alleged to\\nhave participated in the same act or transaction . . . constituting an offense\"\\npursuant to RCr 6.20 and the cases were properly joined under our Rules.\\nAppellant was not prejudiced by the joinder of his and Matt\\'s charges under\\nthis indictment. All of the \"evidence of one offense would be admissible in a\\ntrial of the other offense.\" Rearick, 858 S.W.2d at 187. Therefore, the trial\\ncourt did not abuse its discretion in denying Appellant\\'s motion for severance\\nof the charges included in the same indictment.The charges arising from Matt\\'s separate indictment are a bit more\\nproblematic. Under that indictment, Matt was charged with six counts of first-\\ndegree sexual abuse and seven counts of use of a minor in a sexual\\nperformance. The alleged victims were six of Appellant\\'s children, including\\nSam, and Appellant\\'s step-daughter, Suzie. In addition to Sam and Suzie,\\nthree of Appellant\\'s other children testified about Matt touching them\\ninappropriately, or about seeing Matt touch their siblings or step-sister\\ninappropriately. While the evidence of these other charges would not have\\nbeen admissible in Appellant\\'s trial, we have reviewed the trial record at length\\nand are satisfied with the admonitions the trial court gave the jury. In each\\ninstance, the jury was instructed to only consider the testimony as it related to\\nMatt and not to use it against Appellant in any way. Appellant does not\\nattempt to rebut the presumption that the jury followed the trial court\\'s\\nadmonitions.Appellant also complains that a statement a witness (Matt\\'s ex-girlfriend)\\nmade prejudiced him. That witness testified that Matt \"would get around them\\n[(Appellant\\'s children)] and always tell me that he was going to fuck them in the\\nass or make them suck his dick. And he would always say he always wanted a\\nschool boy, he would fuck one eight to eighty.\" The jury was also admonished\\nthat this testimony only concerned Matt and that it was not to use any of this\\nwitness\\'s testimony against Appellant. We note again that \"[a] jury is\\npresumed to follow an admonition to disregard evidence and the admonition\\nthus cures any error.\" Johnson 105 S.W.3d at 441. \"Nor does [Appellant]\\npresent any argument to rebut the presumption that the trial court\\'s\\nadmonition cured the error,\" Mills v. Commonwealth, 996 S.W.2d 473, 485 (Ky.\\n1999) overruled on other grounds by Padgett v. Commonwealth, 312 S.W.3d 336\\n(Ky. 2010). As such, we hold that the trial court\\'s admonitions cured any error\\nresulting from the joinder of Appellant\\'s and Matt\\'s indictments.',\n",
       " '      Furthermore, Appellant\\'s argument that the evidence should not have\\nbeen admitted, as \"unless a collateral act has some direct relationship to the\\ncharge being tried, its admission necessarily depends on the view that the\\ndefendant\\'s character and predisposition are probative of his guilt,\" Rearick,\\n858 S.W.2d at 187, is without merit. None of the complained of testimony was\\nadmitted against Appellant; but, rather, it was admitted against Matt and the\\njury was specifically directed not to use it in any way against Appellant.',\n",
       " \"      As to Appellant's contention that his sentence reflects the fact that\\nevidence of his brother's crimes prejudiced the jury against him, we point out\\nthat the most inflammatory witness statements in the case would have come in\\nas evidence in Appellant's trial regardless of whether it was joined with his\\nbrother's. In addition to Sam's testimony that his father sodomized him on at\\nleast two occasions in the bathroom of their home, Suzie (who had lived with\\nAppellant since she was around eighteen months old) also testified that\\nAppellant had anally raped her in the same bathroom described by Sam. (This\\ntestimony will be discussed in more detail below.) While the evidence against\\nMatt included testimony by several of the children that he had fondled their\\nbreasts and/or genital areas inside or outside their clothing or exposed himself\\nto the children or had the children disrobe for him, the trial court admonished\\nthe jury not to consider this evidence against Appellant. We believe that the\\nfact that two child witnesses testified that Appellant had anally raped themâ\\x80\\x94\\nand the fact Appellant served as a father figure to both of themâ\\x80\\x94is enough to\\naccount for the jury's recommended sentence without accounting for any\\nalleged prejudice.\",\n",

Corn., 685 S.W.2d 549, 552 (Ky. 1985), this Court held\\n\"[e]vidence of independent sexual acts between the accused and persons other\\nthan the victim are admissible if such acts are similar to that charged and not\\ntoo remote in time provided the acts are relevant to prove intent, motive or a\\ncommon plan or pattern of activity.\" Appellant argues that Pendleton is\\ndistinguishable from his case for several reasons. First, he argues that the\\nfacts that Suzie and Sam are of different genders and ages, and that Suzie is\\nnot his biological daughter, while Sam is his biological son, make the acts\\ndissimilar. We disagree. The sexual actâ\\x80\\x94anal sodomyâ\\x80\\x94was the same in both\\ninstances. The fact that Suzie happened to be female did not alter the type of\\nsexual act Appellant subjected her to.

We do not believe this approximate\\nfour-year age difference is enough to say that the acts are not of a similar\\nnature. Finally, Appellant was the only father figure Suzie had ever known.\\nShe and Appellant had lived in the same home since she was eighteen months\\nold. As the trial court found, Appellant was a father figure for both Suzie and\\nSam when he sodomized them.',\n",

When\\nthey testified at trial, Suzie was sixteen years old and Sam was twelve. Suzie's\\nabuse occurred when she was between the ages of twelve and fourteen (or two\\nto four years prior to the trial) and the last time Sam described being\\nsodomized occurred when he was about eight years old (or about four years\\nbefore trial).

       " '      The next Bell factor required the trial court to determine if Suzie\\'s\\ntestimony of Appellant\\'s other sexual acts was sufficiently probative and, if so,\\nwhether the probative value was outweighed by undue prejudice. Appellant\\npoints out our language in Driver v. Commonwealth, 361 S.W.3d 877, 885-86\\n(Ky. 2012), that \"prior acts of violence or threats of violence against persons\\nother than the victim in the case on trial have significantly less probative value\\nthan similar prior acts and threats against the same victim.\" He goes on to\\nnote that lain exception has been recognized when the threat against the third\\nperson is so close in time to the charged offense as to be considered a part of\\nthe same transaction.\" Id. at 886 citing Chatt v. Commonwealth, 268 Ky. 141,\\n103 S.W.2d 952, 954-955 (Ky. 1937). However, we emphasize that these were\\nnot threats of violence as contemplated by Driver and Chatt; nor were they\\nunproven allegations of sexual abuse brought up for the first time at trial, as\\nwas the case in Bell. Rather, Suzie\\'s testimony was describing abuse for which\\nAppellant had been previously charged and to which he had already pled guilty\\n(thought this fact was not revealed to the jury). We cannot hold that the trial\\ncourt abused its discretion in allowing the testimony to come in under these\\nfactorsâ\\x80\\x94it was close enough in time and circumstances to be considered part\\nof the same transaction and to show a course of conduct. Moreover, as this\\nCourt held in Commonwealth v. English, 993 S.W.2d 941, 945 (Ky. 1999):\\n      [t]he test of relevancy having been satisfied by proof of a modus\\n      operandi, the evidence of [Appellant\\'s] prior sexual misconduct was\\n      properly admitted unless its probative value was substantially\\n      outweighed by the danger of undue prejudice.

However, it is not the sole determining\\n      factor. While temporal remoteness tends to lessen the probative\\n      value of the evidence of Appellee\\'s prior sexual misconduct, its\\n      probativeness is conversely heightened by the multiplicity of\\n      victims, the multiplicity of occurrences, and the fact that the abuse\\n      was perpetrated against members of several generations of the\\n      same family. Lear v. Commonwealth, Ky., 884 S.W.2d 657 (1994).\\n      The balancing of the probative value of such evidence against the\\n      danger of undue prejudice is a task properly reserved for the sound\\n      discretion of the trial judge.

The government referenced a statement that Trice had given to\\npolice after the shooting when she had been arrested for her own alleged involvement. The\\ngovernment offered the statement to Trice to refresh her recollection. Trice then testified that, at 4\\np.m., Jones had said â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been taken care ofâ\\x80\\x9d and â\\x80\\x9c[h]e already paid someone.â\\x80\\x9d Id. at\\n40.

Defense counsel also asked a series\\nof questions to undermine the credibility of Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statement to the police: she had been arrested,\\nwas poorly treated, did not write the statement herself, and signed it while scared, threatened, and\\nhungry. Based on this latter set of questions, the trial court ruled that defense counsel had opened\\nthe door to the hearsay statements, permitting the government to rehabilitate Trice with her\\nconsistent, pre-arrest statements. Wilson, Emma Flowers, and Adams testified to the statements\\nâ\\x80\\x9cthat Nook was going to take care of it that day,â\\x80\\x9d id.

First, he asserts that his\\nattorney provided ineffective assistance by opening the door for Triceâ\\x80\\x99s prior statements to come into\\nevidence by discrediting Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statement to the police, even though her statement to the police was\\nnot actually admitted into evidence. Second, he complains that his attorney did not request that the\\njudge instruct the jury to consider Wilsonâ\\x80\\x99s, Adamsâ\\x80\\x99s, and Emma Flowersâ\\x80\\x99s testimony only for its\\nimpeachment value. To succeed on his ineffective-assistance claim, Jones must show that the state\\ncourts unreasonably applied Strickland v. Washington, 466 U.S. 668, 687 (1984), which requires both deficient performance and prejudice to the defense. Attorney performance is deficient if\\nâ\\x80\\x9ccounselâ\\x80\\x99s representation fell below an objective standard of reasonablenessâ\\x80\\x9d by making â\\x80\\x9cerrors so\\nserious that counsel was not functioning as the â\\x80\\x98counselâ\\x80\\x99 guaranteed . . . by the Sixth Amendment.â\\x80\\x9d\\nId. at 687â\\x80\\x9388. â\\x80\\x9cOur review of counselâ\\x80\\x99s performance is highly deferential and counsel is strongly\\npresumed to have rendered adequate assistance and made all significant decisions in the exercise of\\nreasonable professional judgment.â\\x80\\x9d Johnson v.

       " 'True\\tJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT\\t1. Opening the Door For Prejudicial Hearsay',\n",
       " '       Opening the door to damaging testimony can constitute deficient performance. See, e.g.,\\nWhite v. Thaler, 610 F.3d 890, 900 (5th Cir. 2010). Here, however, the Michigan Court of Appeals\\nfound that opening the door was a necessary consequence of the defenseâ\\x80\\x99s much-needed attack on\\nTriceâ\\x80\\x99s credibility. That consequence was damaging, but we consider it in context, alongside the\\nbeneficial results of the strategy and in light of counselâ\\x80\\x99s slim options. See Wiggins v. Smith, 539\\nU.S. 510, 523 (2003) (using â\\x80\\x9ca context-dependent consideration of the challenged [attorney] conductâ\\x80\\x9d).On direct examination, Trice had testified to Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s statements that â\\x80\\x9c[t]he order had been\\ntaken care of,â\\x80\\x9d â\\x80\\x9c[h]e already paid someone,â\\x80\\x9d and he had done â\\x80\\x9c[w]hat you thought.â\\x80\\x9d R. 17 (06/17/03\\nTrial Tr., Trice at 40, 44). Although Triceâ\\x80\\x99s police statement had not been admitted into evidence,\\nthe jury was aware of her statement to police because the prosecution had referenced it when\\nrefreshing Triceâ\\x80\\x99s recollection. Jones admits that direct examination implied that the police report\\nwas consistent with Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statements. Doing nothing to counter these damaging claims and\\nimplications on cross-examination would not have been a wise choice, despite what Jones argues\\nnow. The Michigan Court of Appeals did not unreasonably determine that, â\\x80\\x9c[b]ecause of the nature\\nof [Triceâ\\x80\\x99s statements on direct], defense counsel would have been remiss not to address the\\nstatements on cross-examination and attempt to explain them.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578, at *3.',\n",
       " '       Debunking the police report removed any enhanced credibility that the police report had\\nadded to Triceâ\\x80\\x99s testimony. Jones argues that his attorney performed deficiently because she acted\\non the false belief that the police report was in evidence. But his attorney explicitly confirmed her\\nunderstanding that the statement was not in evidence. R. 17 at 79 (â\\x80\\x9cTHE COURT: â\\x80\\x98You know, her\\nstatement is actually not in evidence, [defense counsel]. Her trial testimony is.â\\x80\\x99 [DEFENSE\\nCOUNSEL]: â\\x80\\x98I understand.â\\x80\\x99â\\x80\\x9d). Defense counselâ\\x80\\x99s cross-examination was directed at â\\x80\\x9cwhat the\\nprosecutor said when he was asking [Trice] questions. He asked about her [police] statement, what\\nshe said in her statement.â\\x80\\x9d Id.\\nSome portions of the cross-examination strategy did not depend on the police report. For\\nexample, the defense attorney extracted from Trice that she did not know what Jones was talking\\nabout when he referenced the order that he had taken care of or when he said that he had paid\\nsomeone. The judge had warned the defense attorney about the risk of opening the door to\\npreviously excluded testimony. In hindsight, perhaps refraining from asking about the police report\\nwould have been a better strategy. But given the deference with which we review attorney decisions,\\nwe cannot say that the state courts were unreasonable in concluding that the choice was not\\nconstitutionally deficient. The circumstances of the police reportâ\\x80\\x94Triceâ\\x80\\x99s own arrest as well as her\\nmaltreatmentâ\\x80\\x94make her statements dubious. That line of questioning may have had more force than\\ndid Triceâ\\x80\\x99s admission that she felt that Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s statements were ambiguous. Also, each of the\\nhearsay statements relies on Triceâ\\x80\\x99s credibility as a declarant. Jonesâ\\x80\\x99s trial counsel reasonably might\\nhave decided that the benefit of casting doubt on Triceâ\\x80\\x99s testimony outweighed the harm of new\\nwitnesses testifying to statements similar to what that the jury had already heard.',\n",
       " '       The Michigan Court of Appeals held that â\\x80\\x9c[c]ounselâ\\x80\\x99s strategy was clearly to try to show that\\nTrice did not know what defendant meant by the statements. Given counselâ\\x80\\x99s limited options, this\\nstrategy was not unsound.â\\x80\\x9d Jones, 2005 WL 657578, at *3. The attorneyâ\\x80\\x99s strategy was somewhat\\nbroader in that it probed the circumstances of the police report, but the state court was not\\nunreasonable in determining that the attorney exercised professional judgment and provided\\nconstitutionally adequate assistance. Thus, Jones cannot demonstrate ineffective assistance of\\ncounsel.',\n",
